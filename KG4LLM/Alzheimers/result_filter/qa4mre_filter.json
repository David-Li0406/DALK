The mechanism underlying this association is unclear. Here, we report that CLU1 and CLU2 are the two primary CLU isoforms in human brain; CLU1 and CLU2 share exons 2\u20139 but differ in exon 1 and proximal promoters. The expression of both CLU1 and CLU2 was increased in individuals with significant AD neuropathology. However, only CLU1 was associated with the rs11136000 genotype, with the minor \u201cprotective\u201d rs11136000T allele being associated with increased CLU1 expression. Since CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively, we compared their expression; for both CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells, clusterin is present in the secretory pathway, accumulates in the extracellular media, and is similar in size to clusterin in human brain. Overall, we interpret these results as indicating that the AD-protective minor rs11136000T allele is associated with increased CLU1 expression. Since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce similar proteins and are increased in AD, the AD-protection afforded by the rs11136000T allele may reflect increased soluble clusterin throughout life.Citation: Ling I-F, Bhongsatiern J, Simpson JF, Fardo DW, Estus S (2012) Genetics of Clusterin Isoform Expression and Alzheimer's Disease Risk.

Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear, CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence, including (I) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [5], [6], (ii) clusterin is a component of plaques [4], [5], [7], (iii) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [1], [8], [9] and (iv) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta (A\u00df) chaperone to alter A\u00df aggregation and/or clearance ([10], [11], reviewed in [4], [12], [13], [14]). The physiologic relevance of CLU to AD was confirmed recently when CLU single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s were associated with AD risk [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Overall, CLU genetic variation is essentially unequivocally associated with AD given the robust statistical power of the initial genome-wide association studies and subsequent replication studies [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. How CLU SNPs modulate clusterin to alter AD risk is unknown.Two CLU isoforms, CLU1 and CLU2, have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear protein and CLU2 a secreted protein (reviewed in [20]). Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two, which encodes the leader sequence, resulting in another nuclear clusterin [21], [22]. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs. We identified CLU1 and CLU2 as the major CLU isoforms in human brain. Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000. Lastly, although CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to produce intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively, immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicate that CLU1 and CLU2 both produce secreted proteins that are similar to those detected in the human brain. Overall, we interpret our results as suggesting that SNP-mediated increases in secreted, soluble clusterin expression may act to reduce AD risk.Methods Top Ethics StatementThe work described here was performed with approval from the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board.Cell CultureSH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma) and HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 - 95% air atmosphere.CLU Expression PlasmidExpression plasmids encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were generated from SH-SY5Y cellular mRNA that was reverse transcribed by using the primer 5\u2032-TAGGTGCAAAAGCAACAT-3\u2032 which corresponds to sequence just after the CLU stop codon. CLU1 and CLU2 cDNAs were then amplified by PCR with forward primers 5\u2032-TGAGTCATGCAGGTTTGCAG-3\u2032 (CLU1) and 5\u2032-ATGATGAAGACTCTGCTGCTG-3\u2032 (CLU2) used in combination with the common reverse primer 5\u2032-CTCCTCCCGGTGCTTTTTG-3\u2032. PCR fragments were ligated into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO T/A cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Clones encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were detected by PCR screening and clone integrity confirmed by sequencing.Human Autopsy TissueDe-identified human brain specimens were provided by the University of Kentucky AD Center Neuropathology Core [23], [24]. AD and non-AD designations followed NIARI neuropathology guidelines, which include indices of neuritic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and provide a likelihood staging of AD neuropathological diagnosis [25], [26]. Individuals with \u201clow\u201d AD neuropathology were cognitively intact prior to death and had no or low likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria; their average age at death was 81.8\u00b110.2 (mean \u00b1SD, n = 17). Individuals with \u201chigh\u201d AD neuropathology represented a combination of demented individuals with high likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria (n = 27) and cognitively intact individuals that were found to have moderate or high AD neuropathology at death (n = 7); their average age at death was 81.9\u00b16.2 (mean \u00b1SD, n = 34). The average post-mortem interval (PMI) for low AD neuropathology individuals was 3.0\u00b10.8 hours (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 17) while the PMI for high AD neuropathology individuals was similar (3.2\u00b10.8 hours (n = 34)). Choroid plexus samples were from six individuals with an average age at death of 80.0\u00b1 3.3 years and PMI of 2.9\u00b11.1 hours. Fetal tissue RNA samples were obtained commercially (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) and have been described previously [27].PCR AmplificationTotal RNA was extracted from human brain specimens and converted to cDNA in 1 \u00b5g aliquots with random hexamers and reverse transcriptase (SuperScript III, Invitrogen), essentially as we described previously [24], [28], [29], [30]. PCR primers were designed such that the splicing of each internal CLU exon as well as CLU1 and CLU2 were evaluated (Table 1). In initial screening, cDNA pooled from five high AD neuropathology and five low AD neuropathology samples were subjected to PCR-amplification (Platinum Taq, Invitrogen) by using each primer pair and a PCR profile consisting of initial denaturation for 5 minutes at 95\u00b0C, followed by 27\u201332 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min (Perkin Elmer 9600). PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, stained with SYBR Gold and visualized by using a fluorescence imager (Fuji FLA-2000). The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing (Davis Sequencing, Davis, CA).thumbnailTable 1. PCR Primers for evaluating splice variation.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.t001 Real-time PCRThe expression level of CLU1 and CLU2 was quantified by real-time PCR. Each isoform was specifically amplified by using a sense primer corresponding to sequence within their respective exon 1, i.e., 5\u2032-GCGAGCAGAGCGCTATAAAT-3\u2032 for CLU1 and 5\u2032-AGATGGATTCGGTGTGAAGG-3\u2032 for CLU2\u2032, and an antisense primer corresponding to sequence at the exon 2\u20133 boundary, i.e., 5\u2032-GACATTTCCTGGAGCTCATTG-3\u2032. Note that the CLU1 sense primer contains the TATA sequence suggested by Schepeler et al to be present only in a longer \u201cCLU34\u201d isoform [31]. The 20 \u00b5l real-time PCR mixture containing approximately 20 ng of brain cDNA, 1 \u00b5M of each primer and 1\u00d7 PerfecTaq PCRSupermix (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD) was subjected to real-time PCR (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). PCR profiles consisted of pre-incubation at 95\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 20 s. Specificity of the reactions was evaluated by showing a single PCR product by gel electrophoresis and by performing a melting curve analysis after PCR amplification. The PCR product copy number in each sample was determined relative to standard curves that were amplified in parallel and were based upon previously purified and quantified PCR products. The copy numbers were then normalized to the geometric mean of the copy numbers of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 and ribosomal protein L13A as described (Vandesompele et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2005). All real-time PCR assays were repeated twice.GenotypingDNA samples were genotyped for rs11136000 by using unlabeled PCR primers and TaqMan FAM and VIC dye-labeled MGB probes (Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on a real-time PCR machine (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).Statistical AnalysisVariation in CLU isoform expression were analyzed as a function of rs11136000 genotype, AD neuropathology, sex and age by using a general linear model (SPSS v.18 (IBM, Somers, NY)). A dominant mode of inheritance was assumed to maximize statistical power.ImmunofluorescenceCLU expression plasmids were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN). Briefly, 3.75\u00d7104 cells/well were maintained in a poly-L-lysine treated 8-well chamber coverglass (Lab-Tek, Nunc, Rochester, NY) and transfected the next day with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 minutes. Non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells with 5% goat serum in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) for 1 hour and the cells were then incubated with mouse anti-V5 antibody (1:1000 dilution, ab27671, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and either rabbit anti-calnexin antibody (1:200 dilution, SPA-860, Stressgen, Victoria, BC, Canada) or rabbit anti-TGN46 antibody (1:1000 dilution, ab16052, Abcam) in 5% goat serum at 4\u00b0C overnight. The next day, cells were washed with PBST three times and incubated with a mixture containing Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:200 dilution, Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) and Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:200 dilution, Molecular Probes) in 5% goat serum at room temperature for an hour. After washing with PBST, cells were stained with 10 \u00b5g/ml of Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes) for 30 minutes, washed with PBS, and subjected to fluorescence microscopy.Western BlotSH-SY5Y cells or HepG2 cells were grown in a 100 mm dish (2.6\u00d7106 cells/dish) for 24 hours and then transfected with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Sciences). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell medium was replaced with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and cells maintained for another 24 hours. The conditioned medium was collected and the cells washed with 5 ml of room-temperature PBS. Cells were then lysed in 0.5 ml of RIPA butter (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) containing 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Sciences) for 30 minutes on ice with occasional rocking. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C and the supernatant collected. Conditioned medium was centrifuged at 250\u00d7g for 10 minutes and 0.5 ml of the supernatant was collected and supplemented with 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science). Human brain anterior cingulate tissue samples were prepared by homogenizing ~0.5 mg tissue in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail, centrifuging at 14,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C, and then collecting the supernatant. After the protein concentration of each sample was determined (Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit, Pierce, Rockford, IL), 15 or 20 \u00b5g protein were mixed with SDS sample loading buffer containing \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 minutes and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The blots were then incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature and probed overnight with mouse anti-V5 antibody (1:5000 dilution, Abcam) or mouse anti-clusterin antibody (1:200, B-5 Santa-Cruz) at 4\u00b0C. After washing with PBST four times for 5 minutes each, the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (1:1,000 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 hour at room temperature. Bound peroxidase was visualized by using a SuperSignal West Pico kit (Pierce) and a molecular imager (ChemiDoc XRS System, Bio-Rad). For studies involving PNGase F digestion, each protein sample was treated with PNGase F as directed by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Briefly, 15 \u00b5g protein of each sample was denatured at 100\u00b0C for 10 minutes and incubated with 1,500 units of PNGase F at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours. Samples were then analyzed by Western blot as described above.Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression, we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain. Previously reported isoforms include CLU1 and CLU2, which are identical in exons 2\u20139 but differ in exon 1, as well as isoforms lacking exons 2 or 5 ([21], [22], reviewed in [20]). RT-PCR analyses of pooled human brain cDNA samples detected only CLU1 and CLU2 (Figure 1A\u20131B). CLU2 translation is predicted to result in a secreted protein, beginning at the initial ATG in exon 2 that is common to both CLU2 and CLU1 (Figure 1C). In contrast, CLU1 translation is predicted to initiate at an ATG within its exon 1, which is in-frame with the ATG site in the common exon 2. Hence, CLU1 is predicted to encode a protein identical to that encoded by CLU2 except that the CLU1 protein would contain 52 additional amino acids at its amino terminus (Figure 1C). This change is predicted by PSORTII to result in an intracellular and likely nuclear, form of clusterin (reviewed in [20]). In summary, CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in brain and are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively.thumbnailFigure 1. CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms expressed in human brain.The exon layout for the CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms is shown (A). Coding and non-coding exonic regions are represented by black and white boxes, respectively, while introns are shown as thin black lines. The first ATG site in each isoform is shown as well. Evaluation of CLU splicing by RT-PCR identified only CLU1 and CLU2 in human brain cDNA (B), i.e., single PCR products are observed upon amplification from exon 1a \u2013 exon 5 (lane 1), exon 1b \u2013 exon 5 (lane 2), exon 4 \u2013 exon 6 (lane 3) and exon 5 \u2013 exon 9 (lane 4). Molecular weight markers are shown at the left. The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2, beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A, are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2. The boxed amino acid sequence represents signal sequence that is removed from clusterin-2 upon its translocation to the ER. Two nuclear localization sequences, as predicted by PSORT II (http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form2.htm l), are underlined. The asterisk shows the clusterin cleavage site that separates the \u03b1- and \u03b2- subunits.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.g001 To evaluate whether rs11136000, the primary AD-related CLU SNP [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], is associated with CLU expression, we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 expression in a series of brain samples. The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2\u20133 boundary. Copy numbers were determined relative to a standard curve for each isoform and normalized to the geometric mean of housekeeping genes [23], [32]. The expression of CLU1 and CLU2 were modestly coordinately regulated (Figure 2A), with CLU2 being consistently greater than CLU1; the overall CLU2: CLU1 ratio was 3.35\u00b11.84 (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 51). To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression, we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples (Figure 2B). Among the fetal tissues, the CLU2: CLU1 ratio varied widely from 0.3 (skin) to 6.2 (kidney) (Figure 2B). The CLU2:CLU1 ratio in choroid plexus, which produces cerebrospinal fluid, was 5.72\u00b10.65 (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 6).thumbnailFigure 2. Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues.CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms were quantified by isoform-specific RT-PCR in a series of adult human cingulate and choroid plexus samples (A\u2013B) as well as a human fetal tissues (B). Within A, each marker reflects the expression of CLU1 and CLU2, normalized to housekeeping genes, in a single brain sample. Within B, the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1:CLU2 ratio. CLU1 expression shows a positive association with AD neuropathology and rs11136000T allele (C). CLU2 expression was increased in individuals with AD pathology and decreased with age (D\u2013E).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.g002 We next evaluated CLU isoform expression as a function of AD neuropathology, rs11136000 status, sex and age. We found that CLU1 expression was significantly increased with high AD neuropathology and the minor rs11136000T allele (Figure 2C, Table 2). In contrast, CLU2 expression was significantly increased with AD neuropathology but not rs11136000 genotype, and decreased with age (Figure 2D\u2013E, Table 3). Overall, both CLU1 and CLU2 expression was increased with AD, confirming prior reports. However, only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000. Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk.thumbnailTable 2. Analysis of CLU1 Expression.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.t002 thumbnailTable 3. Analysis of CLU2 Expression.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.t003 CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively (Figure 1). Therefore, we evaluated the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to discern whether these corresponded to the intracellular and secreted forms of clusterin that have been reported [4], [8], [33]. When each isoform was transiently transfected into neural SH-SY5Y cells, immunofluorescence analyses showed a similar subcellular localization pattern (Figure 3). The proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 tended to concentrate within the Golgi apparatus, as established by double-labeling with an antibody against trans-Golgi network protein 46 (TGN46) (Figure 3A). Relatively modest amounts of clusterin were also detected within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as established by double labeling with calnexin (Figure 3B). Nuclear, cytosolic, or mitochondrial-associated clusterin was not observed. Hence, the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 manifests an intracellular localization that includes the ER and Golgi, consistent with a possible secretory pathway for both proteins.thumbnailFigure 3. CLU1 and CLU2 encoded proteins are localized to the ER and Golgi.SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with vectors encoding CLU1 and CLU2; the resultant clusterin expression was localized by a vector-derived V5 epitope tag. The subcellular localization for both proteins overlapped with the Golgi, as shown by co-labeling with antibody against TGN46 (A) and with the ER, as shown by co-labeling with an antibody against calnexin (B).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.g003 CLU1 is predicted to encode a 501 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 57.8 kDa while CLU2 is predicted to encode 449 amino acids, totaling 52.5 kDa. During maturation of secreted clusterin, the protein is N-glycosylated and proteolyzed to generate a heterodimer that is maintained by disulfide bonds [20]. To compare the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2, we performed Western blot analyses of transfected SH-SY5Y cells; ectopic clusterin was detected via a V5 epitope tag (Figure 4 A\u2013B). Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size (Figure 4A). To discern whether glycosylation differences may obscure differences in the clusterin molecular weight derived from their primary sequence, the protein mixtures were digested with PNGase F to remove N-linked sugars prior to electrophoresis; the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells were both decreased similarly by PNGase treatment (Figure 4B). We considered the possibility that CLU translation may show cell-type specificity, and therefore repeated this study in an unrelated cell line by transfecting CLU1 and CLU2 into HepG2 cells. As with the SH-SY5Y cells, CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells produced clusterin of similar size, even after PNGase F digestion (Figure 4C). Hence, we found no evidence to suggest that the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 differ in cellular localization, size, glycosylation, or proteolytic cleavage. Rather, when these Western blot studies are considered in combination with the immunofluorescence studies, CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce equivalent proteins that are similarly translated, glycosylated, and cleaved as they pass through the ER and Golgi in the secretory pathway to the extracellular space.thumbnailFigure 4. CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.Transfection of CLU1 and CLU2 resulted in proteins of similar size, appearing as both intact and cleaved clusterin in cell lysates and conditioned media; the proteins resulting from CLU transfection were detected via their V5 epitope tag (A\u2013B). PNGase F treatment prior to electrophoresis reduced the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 similarly (B). The apparent doublet in the protein encoded by CLU1 at 37 kDa was variable between experiments and likely reflects incomplete glycosylation as the doublet collapsed to a single band after PNGase F digestion. Results similar to those depicted in B were obtained when CLU1 and CLU2 were transfected into HepG2 cells (C). When transfected and endogenous clusterin proteins were detected with an antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal clusterin epitope (D\u2013E), intact clusterin from transfection (T-labeled arrow) was slightly larger than endogenous clusterin (E-labeled arrow), reflecting the ~5.1 kDa V5 epitope and His tags in the ectopic clusterin (D). The bands labeled \u201cFragments\u201d are clusterin alpha subunits derived from variably glycosylated endogenous and transfected clusterin. Overall, the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin, as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions (D) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions (E).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo, we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody. Endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells migrates at a slightly lower molecular weight than that resulting from CLU transfection, reflecting the 5.1 kDa V5/His tag encoded by the pcDNA3.1 vector expressing transfected CLU (Figure 4D). Importantly, this 5.1 kDa size difference between endogenous and transfected clusterin is similar to the size difference between the CLU1 and CLU2-predicted proteins, indicating that if the proteins encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 differed by 5 kDa, the proteins would be resolved easily under these experimental conditions. The endogenous SH-SY5Y clusterin migrates similarly to the intact protein detected in brain homogenates suggesting these cellular forms are similar to those present in vivo (Figure 4D). To extend this analysis to the heterodimeric form of clusterin, we also performed electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions. We found that heterodimeric protein from CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells appeared similar in size to each other and to the forms found in brain (Figure 4E). Hence, CLU1 and CLU2 produce proteins in vitro that are similar in size to endogenous clusterin in vitro and human brain.Discussion Top The main findings of this report are several. First, CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in human brain and differ in their first exon and proximal promoter. Second, the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology. Third, CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain. Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele, which is also associated with reduced AD risk, we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk. Overall, these results identify a possible means underlying the association of rs11136000 with AD risk.The association between CLU expression and rs11136000 was discerned because the CLU isoforms were analyzed separately. For example, when we analyzed total CLU expression in the same fashion as reported here, total CLU was not associated with rs11136000 (p = 0.51) although a robust association with AD pathology was observed (p = 0.005, Ling et al., unpublished observations). The lack of a significant association between rs11136000 and total CLU is somewhat disconcerting since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce a similar protein. We speculate that (i) the threshold for clusterin biological significance may be less than the threshold for overall CLU statistical significance and/or (ii) CLU1 may be enriched in a cell type different than CLU2, which may affect its functionality. We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [17], [34]. As the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appears similar, discerning an association between rs11136000 and clusterin would be especially challenging in tissues with a large proportion of CLU2. In this regard, CLU2 was the major isoform in choroid plexus, suggesting that an association between cerebrospinal fluid clusterin and rs11136000 would be difficult to detect. The differential regulation of CLU1 and CLU2 was not unexpected because CLU1 and CLU2 have separate proximal promoter regions. Consistent with this observation, Cochrane et al found that androgen-treatment in a prostate cancer cell line decreased CLU1 expression while enhancing CLU2 expression [35]. Although the identification of the functional SNPs and transcription factors that modulate CLU expression is beyond the scope of this report, we note that rs11136000 resides within intron 3 and is common to both CLU1 and CLU2. Hence, rs11136000 is likely not functional but rather is in linkage with a functional SNP more proximal to the CLU1 promoter. In summary, the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately.Since earlier predictions were that CLU2 encodes a secreted protein while the additional 52 amino-terminal residues encoded by CLU1 would result in its intracellular localization [20], we expected clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to differ in cellular locale and size. In support of this prediction, the ATG translation initiation sites in the CLU1-specific exon 1a as well as the common exon 2 both satisfy Kozak consensus sequence requirements (http://bioinfo.iitk.ac.in/AUGPred/). However, clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells was localized to the secretory pathway and was equivalent in size under conditions that would easily discern their predicted five kDa size difference, especially after PNGase F treatment to remove sugar residues. Hence, CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro. Comparable results were obtained in two cell types, suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein. The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG. The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded. Distinguishing among these possibilities is a future direction for this work. Overall, we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other, and similar in size to those present in human brain, leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo.A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk. Furthermore, since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease, we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset, mimicking the likely SNP effects. One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [35]. Stress has also been shown to upregulate CLU in many instances [36] and may cause the AD-associated increase in CLU observed here. In terms of possible therapeutic agents, multiple histone deacetylase inhibitors increase CLU expression robustly in vitro [37]. Interestingly, one member of this class, valproate, increases CLU expression in human astrocytes [37] and reduces amyloid accumulation as well as behavioral deficits in mouse amyloid models [38], [39]. While valproate may also act via other mechanisms [38], the actions of valproate on CLU expression may be relevant to its neuroprotection and merit further exploration to reduce AD risk.Limitations of this study include that rs11136000 and AD neuropathological status capture only ~20% of the variance in CLU expression. Identifying the unknown factors that account for the additional variance, which could include epigenetic factors, will facilitate understanding of CLU expression. Moreover, variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here, suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community. Additionally, since the nuclear form of clusterin arising from an isoform lacking exon 2 has been associated with apoptosis [21], [22], this isoform may be transiently expressed and hence below our limits of detection, especially in comparison with CLU1 and CLU2.In conclusion, the AD-protective allele of rs11136000 was associated with increased expression of CLU1 but not CLU2 in our dataset. Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble, secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain. Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately.Acknowledgments Top The authors gratefully acknowledge tissue supplied by the University of Kentucky AD Center and Ishita Parikh for technical assistance.Author Contributions Top Conceived and designed the experiments: IL SE.

The mechanism underlying this association is unclear. Here, we report that CLU1 and CLU2 are the two primary CLU isoforms in human brain; CLU1 and CLU2 share exons 2\u20139 but differ in exon 1 and proximal promoters. The expression of both CLU1 and CLU2 was increased in individuals with significant AD neuropathology.

Since CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively, we compared their expression; for both CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells, clusterin is present in the secretory pathway, accumulates in the extracellular media, and is similar in size to clusterin in human brain. Overall, we interpret these results as indicating that the AD-protective minor rs11136000T allele is associated with increased CLU1 expression. Since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce similar proteins and are increased in AD, the AD-protection afforded by the rs11136000T allele may reflect increased soluble clusterin throughout life.Citation: Ling I-F, Bhongsatiern J, Simpson JF, Fardo DW, Estus S (2012) Genetics of Clusterin Isoform Expression and Alzheimer's Disease Risk.

Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear, CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence, including (I) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [5], [6], (ii) clusterin is a component of plaques [4], [5], [7], (iii) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [1], [8], [9] and (iv) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta (A\u00df) chaperone to alter A\u00df aggregation and/or clearance ([10], [11], reviewed in [4], [12], [13], [14]). The physiologic relevance of CLU to AD was confirmed recently when CLU single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s were associated with AD risk [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Overall, CLU genetic variation is essentially unequivocally associated with AD given the robust statistical power of the initial genome-wide association studies and subsequent replication studies [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. How CLU SNPs modulate clusterin to alter AD risk is unknown.Two CLU isoforms, CLU1 and CLU2, have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear protein and CLU2 a secreted protein (reviewed in [20]). Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two, which encodes the leader sequence, resulting in another nuclear clusterin [21], [22]. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs. We identified CLU1 and CLU2 as the major CLU isoforms in human brain. Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000. Lastly, although CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to produce intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively, immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicate that CLU1 and CLU2 both produce secreted proteins that are similar to those detected in the human brain. Overall, we interpret our results as suggesting that SNP-mediated increases in secreted, soluble clusterin expression may act to reduce AD risk.Methods Top Ethics StatementThe work described here was performed with approval from the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board.Cell CultureSH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma) and HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 - 95% air atmosphere.CLU Expression PlasmidExpression plasmids encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were generated from SH-SY5Y cellular mRNA that was reverse transcribed by using the primer 5\u2032-TAGGTGCAAAAGCAACAT-3\u2032 which corresponds to sequence just after the CLU stop codon. CLU1 and CLU2 cDNAs were then amplified by PCR with forward primers 5\u2032-TGAGTCATGCAGGTTTGCAG-3\u2032 (CLU1) and 5\u2032-ATGATGAAGACTCTGCTGCTG-3\u2032 (CLU2) used in combination with the common reverse primer 5\u2032-CTCCTCCCGGTGCTTTTTG-3\u2032. PCR fragments were ligated into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO T/A cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Clones encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were detected by PCR screening and clone integrity confirmed by sequencing.Human Autopsy TissueDe-identified human brain specimens were provided by the University of Kentucky AD Center Neuropathology Core [23], [24]. AD and non-AD designations followed NIARI neuropathology guidelines, which include indices of neuritic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and provide a likelihood staging of AD neuropathological diagnosis [25], [26]. Individuals with \u201clow\u201d AD neuropathology were cognitively intact prior to death and had no or low likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria; their average age at death was 81.8\u00b110.2 (mean \u00b1SD, n = 17). Individuals with \u201chigh\u201d AD neuropathology represented a combination of demented individuals with high likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria (n = 27) and cognitively intact individuals that were found to have moderate or high AD neuropathology at death (n = 7); their average age at death was 81.9\u00b16.2 (mean \u00b1SD, n = 34). The average post-mortem interval (PMI) for low AD neuropathology individuals was 3.0\u00b10.8 hours (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 17) while the PMI for high AD neuropathology individuals was similar (3.2\u00b10.8 hours (n = 34)). Choroid plexus samples were from six individuals with an average age at death of 80.0\u00b1 3.3 years and PMI of 2.9\u00b11.1 hours. Fetal tissue RNA samples were obtained commercially (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) and have been described previously [27].PCR AmplificationTotal RNA was extracted from human brain specimens and converted to cDNA in 1 \u00b5g aliquots with random hexamers and reverse transcriptase (SuperScript III, Invitrogen), essentially as we described previously [24], [28], [29], [30]. PCR primers were designed such that the splicing of each internal CLU exon as well as CLU1 and CLU2 were evaluated (Table 1). In initial screening, cDNA pooled from five high AD neuropathology and five low AD neuropathology samples were subjected to PCR-amplification (Platinum Taq, Invitrogen) by using each primer pair and a PCR profile consisting of initial denaturation for 5 minutes at 95\u00b0C, followed by 27\u201332 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min (Perkin Elmer 9600). PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, stained with SYBR Gold and visualized by using a fluorescence imager (Fuji FLA-2000). The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing (Davis Sequencing, Davis, CA).thumbnailTable 1. PCR Primers for evaluating splice variation.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.t001 Real-time PCRThe expression level of CLU1 and CLU2 was quantified by real-time PCR. Each isoform was specifically amplified by using a sense primer corresponding to sequence within their respective exon 1, i.e., 5\u2032-GCGAGCAGAGCGCTATAAAT-3\u2032 for CLU1 and 5\u2032-AGATGGATTCGGTGTGAAGG-3\u2032 for CLU2\u2032, and an antisense primer corresponding to sequence at the exon 2\u20133 boundary, i.e., 5\u2032-GACATTTCCTGGAGCTCATTG-3\u2032. Note that the CLU1 sense primer contains the TATA sequence suggested by Schepeler et al to be present only in a longer \u201cCLU34\u201d isoform [31]. The 20 \u00b5l real-time PCR mixture containing approximately 20 ng of brain cDNA, 1 \u00b5M of each primer and 1\u00d7 PerfecTaq PCRSupermix (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD) was subjected to real-time PCR (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). PCR profiles consisted of pre-incubation at 95\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 20 s. Specificity of the reactions was evaluated by showing a single PCR product by gel electrophoresis and by performing a melting curve analysis after PCR amplification. The PCR product copy number in each sample was determined relative to standard curves that were amplified in parallel and were based upon previously purified and quantified PCR products. The copy numbers were then normalized to the geometric mean of the copy numbers of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 and ribosomal protein L13A as described (Vandesompele et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2005). All real-time PCR assays were repeated twice.GenotypingDNA samples were genotyped for rs11136000 by using unlabeled PCR primers and TaqMan FAM and VIC dye-labeled MGB probes (Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on a real-time PCR machine (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).Statistical AnalysisVariation in CLU isoform expression were analyzed as a function of rs11136000 genotype, AD neuropathology, sex and age by using a general linear model (SPSS v.18 (IBM, Somers, NY)). A dominant mode of inheritance was assumed to maximize statistical power.ImmunofluorescenceCLU expression plasmids were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN). Briefly, 3.75\u00d7104 cells/well were maintained in a poly-L-lysine treated 8-well chamber coverglass (Lab-Tek, Nunc, Rochester, NY) and transfected the next day with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 minutes. Non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells with 5% goat serum in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) for 1 hour and the cells were then incubated with mouse anti-V5 antibody (1:1000 dilution, ab27671, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and either rabbit anti-calnexin antibody (1:200 dilution, SPA-860, Stressgen, Victoria, BC, Canada) or rabbit anti-TGN46 antibody (1:1000 dilution, ab16052, Abcam) in 5% goat serum at 4\u00b0C overnight. The next day, cells were washed with PBST three times and incubated with a mixture containing Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:200 dilution, Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) and Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:200 dilution, Molecular Probes) in 5% goat serum at room temperature for an hour. After washing with PBST, cells were stained with 10 \u00b5g/ml of Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes) for 30 minutes, washed with PBS, and subjected to fluorescence microscopy.Western BlotSH-SY5Y cells or HepG2 cells were grown in a 100 mm dish (2.6\u00d7106 cells/dish) for 24 hours and then transfected with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Sciences). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell medium was replaced with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and cells maintained for another 24 hours. The conditioned medium was collected and the cells washed with 5 ml of room-temperature PBS. Cells were then lysed in 0.5 ml of RIPA butter (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) containing 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Sciences) for 30 minutes on ice with occasional rocking. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C and the supernatant collected. Conditioned medium was centrifuged at 250\u00d7g for 10 minutes and 0.5 ml of the supernatant was collected and supplemented with 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science). Human brain anterior cingulate tissue samples were prepared by homogenizing ~0.5 mg tissue in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail, centrifuging at 14,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C, and then collecting the supernatant. After the protein concentration of each sample was determined (Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit, Pierce, Rockford, IL), 15 or 20 \u00b5g protein were mixed with SDS sample loading buffer containing \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 minutes and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The blots were then incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature and probed overnight with mouse anti-V5 antibody (1:5000 dilution, Abcam) or mouse anti-clusterin antibody (1:200, B-5 Santa-Cruz) at 4\u00b0C. After washing with PBST four times for 5 minutes each, the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (1:1,000 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 hour at room temperature. Bound peroxidase was visualized by using a SuperSignal West Pico kit (Pierce) and a molecular imager (ChemiDoc XRS System, Bio-Rad). For studies involving PNGase F digestion, each protein sample was treated with PNGase F as directed by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Briefly, 15 \u00b5g protein of each sample was denatured at 100\u00b0C for 10 minutes and incubated with 1,500 units of PNGase F at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours. Samples were then analyzed by Western blot as described above.Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression, we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain. Previously reported isoforms include CLU1 and CLU2, which are identical in exons 2\u20139 but differ in exon 1, as well as isoforms lacking exons 2 or 5 ([21], [22], reviewed in [20]). RT-PCR analyses of pooled human brain cDNA samples detected only CLU1 and CLU2 (Figure 1A\u20131B). CLU2 translation is predicted to result in a secreted protein, beginning at the initial ATG in exon 2 that is common to both CLU2 and CLU1 (Figure 1C). In contrast, CLU1 translation is predicted to initiate at an ATG within its exon 1, which is in-frame with the ATG site in the common exon 2. Hence, CLU1 is predicted to encode a protein identical to that encoded by CLU2 except that the CLU1 protein would contain 52 additional amino acids at its amino terminus (Figure 1C). This change is predicted by PSORTII to result in an intracellular and likely nuclear, form of clusterin (reviewed in [20]). In summary, CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in brain and are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively.thumbnailFigure 1. CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms expressed in human brain.The exon layout for the CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms is shown (A). Coding and non-coding exonic regions are represented by black and white boxes, respectively, while introns are shown as thin black lines. The first ATG site in each isoform is shown as well. Evaluation of CLU splicing by RT-PCR identified only CLU1 and CLU2 in human brain cDNA (B), i.e., single PCR products are observed upon amplification from exon 1a \u2013 exon 5 (lane 1), exon 1b \u2013 exon 5 (lane 2), exon 4 \u2013 exon 6 (lane 3) and exon 5 \u2013 exon 9 (lane 4). Molecular weight markers are shown at the left. The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2, beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A, are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2. The boxed amino acid sequence represents signal sequence that is removed from clusterin-2 upon its translocation to the ER. Two nuclear localization sequences, as predicted by PSORT II (http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form2.htm l), are underlined. The asterisk shows the clusterin cleavage site that separates the \u03b1- and \u03b2- subunits.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.g001 To evaluate whether rs11136000, the primary AD-related CLU SNP [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], is associated with CLU expression, we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 expression in a series of brain samples. The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2\u20133 boundary. Copy numbers were determined relative to a standard curve for each isoform and normalized to the geometric mean of housekeeping genes [23], [32]. The expression of CLU1 and CLU2 were modestly coordinately regulated (Figure 2A), with CLU2 being consistently greater than CLU1; the overall CLU2: CLU1 ratio was 3.35\u00b11.84 (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 51). To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression, we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples (Figure 2B). Among the fetal tissues, the CLU2: CLU1 ratio varied widely from 0.3 (skin) to 6.2 (kidney) (Figure 2B). The CLU2:CLU1 ratio in choroid plexus, which produces cerebrospinal fluid, was 5.72\u00b10.65 (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 6).thumbnailFigure 2. Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues.CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms were quantified by isoform-specific RT-PCR in a series of adult human cingulate and choroid plexus samples (A\u2013B) as well as a human fetal tissues (B). Within A, each marker reflects the expression of CLU1 and CLU2, normalized to housekeeping genes, in a single brain sample. Within B, the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1:CLU2 ratio. CLU1 expression shows a positive association with AD neuropathology and rs11136000T allele (C). CLU2 expression was increased in individuals with AD pathology and decreased with age (D\u2013E).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.g002 We next evaluated CLU isoform expression as a function of AD neuropathology, rs11136000 status, sex and age. We found that CLU1 expression was significantly increased with high AD neuropathology and the minor rs11136000T allele (Figure 2C, Table 2). In contrast, CLU2 expression was significantly increased with AD neuropathology but not rs11136000 genotype, and decreased with age (Figure 2D\u2013E, Table 3). Overall, both CLU1 and CLU2 expression was increased with AD, confirming prior reports. However, only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000. Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk.thumbnailTable 2. Analysis of CLU1 Expression.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.t002 thumbnailTable 3. Analysis of CLU2 Expression.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.t003 CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively (Figure 1). Therefore, we evaluated the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to discern whether these corresponded to the intracellular and secreted forms of clusterin that have been reported [4], [8], [33]. When each isoform was transiently transfected into neural SH-SY5Y cells, immunofluorescence analyses showed a similar subcellular localization pattern (Figure 3). The proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 tended to concentrate within the Golgi apparatus, as established by double-labeling with an antibody against trans-Golgi network protein 46 (TGN46) (Figure 3A). Relatively modest amounts of clusterin were also detected within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as established by double labeling with calnexin (Figure 3B). Nuclear, cytosolic, or mitochondrial-associated clusterin was not observed. Hence, the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 manifests an intracellular localization that includes the ER and Golgi, consistent with a possible secretory pathway for both proteins.thumbnailFigure 3. CLU1 and CLU2 encoded proteins are localized to the ER and Golgi.SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with vectors encoding CLU1 and CLU2; the resultant clusterin expression was localized by a vector-derived V5 epitope tag. The subcellular localization for both proteins overlapped with the Golgi, as shown by co-labeling with antibody against TGN46 (A) and with the ER, as shown by co-labeling with an antibody against calnexin (B).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.g003 CLU1 is predicted to encode a 501 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 57.8 kDa while CLU2 is predicted to encode 449 amino acids, totaling 52.5 kDa. During maturation of secreted clusterin, the protein is N-glycosylated and proteolyzed to generate a heterodimer that is maintained by disulfide bonds [20]. To compare the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2, we performed Western blot analyses of transfected SH-SY5Y cells; ectopic clusterin was detected via a V5 epitope tag (Figure 4 A\u2013B). Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size (Figure 4A). To discern whether glycosylation differences may obscure differences in the clusterin molecular weight derived from their primary sequence, the protein mixtures were digested with PNGase F to remove N-linked sugars prior to electrophoresis; the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells were both decreased similarly by PNGase treatment (Figure 4B). We considered the possibility that CLU translation may show cell-type specificity, and therefore repeated this study in an unrelated cell line by transfecting CLU1 and CLU2 into HepG2 cells. As with the SH-SY5Y cells, CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells produced clusterin of similar size, even after PNGase F digestion (Figure 4C). Hence, we found no evidence to suggest that the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 differ in cellular localization, size, glycosylation, or proteolytic cleavage. Rather, when these Western blot studies are considered in combination with the immunofluorescence studies, CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce equivalent proteins that are similarly translated, glycosylated, and cleaved as they pass through the ER and Golgi in the secretory pathway to the extracellular space.thumbnailFigure 4. CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.Transfection of CLU1 and CLU2 resulted in proteins of similar size, appearing as both intact and cleaved clusterin in cell lysates and conditioned media; the proteins resulting from CLU transfection were detected via their V5 epitope tag (A\u2013B). PNGase F treatment prior to electrophoresis reduced the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 similarly (B). The apparent doublet in the protein encoded by CLU1 at 37 kDa was variable between experiments and likely reflects incomplete glycosylation as the doublet collapsed to a single band after PNGase F digestion. Results similar to those depicted in B were obtained when CLU1 and CLU2 were transfected into HepG2 cells (C). When transfected and endogenous clusterin proteins were detected with an antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal clusterin epitope (D\u2013E), intact clusterin from transfection (T-labeled arrow) was slightly larger than endogenous clusterin (E-labeled arrow), reflecting the ~5.1 kDa V5 epitope and His tags in the ectopic clusterin (D). The bands labeled \u201cFragments\u201d are clusterin alpha subunits derived from variably glycosylated endogenous and transfected clusterin. Overall, the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin, as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions (D) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions (E).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo, we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody. Endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells migrates at a slightly lower molecular weight than that resulting from CLU transfection, reflecting the 5.1 kDa V5/His tag encoded by the pcDNA3.1 vector expressing transfected CLU (Figure 4D). Importantly, this 5.1 kDa size difference between endogenous and transfected clusterin is similar to the size difference between the CLU1 and CLU2-predicted proteins, indicating that if the proteins encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 differed by 5 kDa, the proteins would be resolved easily under these experimental conditions. The endogenous SH-SY5Y clusterin migrates similarly to the intact protein detected in brain homogenates suggesting these cellular forms are similar to those present in vivo (Figure 4D). To extend this analysis to the heterodimeric form of clusterin, we also performed electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions. We found that heterodimeric protein from CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells appeared similar in size to each other and to the forms found in brain (Figure 4E). Hence, CLU1 and CLU2 produce proteins in vitro that are similar in size to endogenous clusterin in vitro and human brain.Discussion Top The main findings of this report are several. First, CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in human brain and differ in their first exon and proximal promoter. Second, the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology. Third, CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain. Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele, which is also associated with reduced AD risk, we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk. Overall, these results identify a possible means underlying the association of rs11136000 with AD risk.The association between CLU expression and rs11136000 was discerned because the CLU isoforms were analyzed separately. For example, when we analyzed total CLU expression in the same fashion as reported here, total CLU was not associated with rs11136000 (p = 0.51) although a robust association with AD pathology was observed (p = 0.005, Ling et al., unpublished observations). The lack of a significant association between rs11136000 and total CLU is somewhat disconcerting since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce a similar protein. We speculate that (i) the threshold for clusterin biological significance may be less than the threshold for overall CLU statistical significance and/or (ii) CLU1 may be enriched in a cell type different than CLU2, which may affect its functionality. We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [17], [34]. As the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appears similar, discerning an association between rs11136000 and clusterin would be especially challenging in tissues with a large proportion of CLU2. In this regard, CLU2 was the major isoform in choroid plexus, suggesting that an association between cerebrospinal fluid clusterin and rs11136000 would be difficult to detect. The differential regulation of CLU1 and CLU2 was not unexpected because CLU1 and CLU2 have separate proximal promoter regions. Consistent with this observation, Cochrane et al found that androgen-treatment in a prostate cancer cell line decreased CLU1 expression while enhancing CLU2 expression [35]. Although the identification of the functional SNPs and transcription factors that modulate CLU expression is beyond the scope of this report, we note that rs11136000 resides within intron 3 and is common to both CLU1 and CLU2. Hence, rs11136000 is likely not functional but rather is in linkage with a functional SNP more proximal to the CLU1 promoter. In summary, the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately.Since earlier predictions were that CLU2 encodes a secreted protein while the additional 52 amino-terminal residues encoded by CLU1 would result in its intracellular localization [20], we expected clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to differ in cellular locale and size. In support of this prediction, the ATG translation initiation sites in the CLU1-specific exon 1a as well as the common exon 2 both satisfy Kozak consensus sequence requirements (http://bioinfo.iitk.ac.in/AUGPred/). However, clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells was localized to the secretory pathway and was equivalent in size under conditions that would easily discern their predicted five kDa size difference, especially after PNGase F treatment to remove sugar residues. Hence, CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro. Comparable results were obtained in two cell types, suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein. The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG. The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded. Distinguishing among these possibilities is a future direction for this work. Overall, we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other, and similar in size to those present in human brain, leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo.A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk. Furthermore, since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease, we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset, mimicking the likely SNP effects. One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [35]. Stress has also been shown to upregulate CLU in many instances [36] and may cause the AD-associated increase in CLU observed here. In terms of possible therapeutic agents, multiple histone deacetylase inhibitors increase CLU expression robustly in vitro [37]. Interestingly, one member of this class, valproate, increases CLU expression in human astrocytes [37] and reduces amyloid accumulation as well as behavioral deficits in mouse amyloid models [38], [39]. While valproate may also act via other mechanisms [38], the actions of valproate on CLU expression may be relevant to its neuroprotection and merit further exploration to reduce AD risk.Limitations of this study include that rs11136000 and AD neuropathological status capture only ~20% of the variance in CLU expression. Identifying the unknown factors that account for the additional variance, which could include epigenetic factors, will facilitate understanding of CLU expression. Moreover, variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here, suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community. Additionally, since the nuclear form of clusterin arising from an isoform lacking exon 2 has been associated with apoptosis [21], [22], this isoform may be transiently expressed and hence below our limits of detection, especially in comparison with CLU1 and CLU2.In conclusion, the AD-protective allele of rs11136000 was associated with increased expression of CLU1 but not CLU2 in our dataset. Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble, secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain. Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately.Acknowledgments Top The authors gratefully acknowledge tissue supplied by the University of Kentucky AD Center and Ishita Parikh for technical assistance.Author Contributions Top Conceived and designed the experiments: IL SE.

Simpson1, David W. Fardo2, Steven Estus1*1 Department of Physiology and Sanders-Brown Center on Aging, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America, 2 Department of Biostatistics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of AmericaAbstract Top The minor allele of rs11136000 within CLU is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. The mechanism underlying this association is unclear. Here, we report that CLU1 and CLU2 are the two primary CLU isoforms in human brain; CLU1 and CLU2 share exons 2\u20139 but differ in exon 1 and proximal promoters. The expression of both CLU1 and CLU2 was increased in individuals with significant AD neuropathology. However, only CLU1 was associated with the rs11136000 genotype, with the minor \u201cprotective\u201d rs11136000T allele being associated with increased CLU1 expression. Since CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively, we compared their expression; for both CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells, clusterin is present in the secretory pathway, accumulates in the extracellular media, and is similar in size to clusterin in human brain. Overall, we interpret these results as indicating that the AD-protective minor rs11136000T allele is associated with increased CLU1 expression. Since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce similar proteins and are increased in AD, the AD-protection afforded by the rs11136000T allele may reflect increased soluble clusterin throughout life.Citation: Ling I-F, Bhongsatiern J, Simpson JF, Fardo DW, Estus S (2012) Genetics of Clusterin Isoform Expression and Alzheimer's Disease Risk.

Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear, CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence, including (I) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [5], [6], (ii) clusterin is a component of plaques [4], [5], [7], (iii) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [1], [8], [9] and (iv) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta (A\u00df) chaperone to alter A\u00df aggregation and/or clearance ([10], [11], reviewed in [4], [12], [13], [14]). The physiologic relevance of CLU to AD was confirmed recently when CLU single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s were associated with AD risk [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Overall, CLU genetic variation is essentially unequivocally associated with AD given the robust statistical power of the initial genome-wide association studies and subsequent replication studies [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. How CLU SNPs modulate clusterin to alter AD risk is unknown.Two CLU isoforms, CLU1 and CLU2, have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear protein and CLU2 a secreted protein (reviewed in [20]). Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two, which encodes the leader sequence, resulting in another nuclear clusterin [21], [22]. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs. We identified CLU1 and CLU2 as the major CLU isoforms in human brain. Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000. Lastly, although CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to produce intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively, immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicate that CLU1 and CLU2 both produce secreted proteins that are similar to those detected in the human brain. Overall, we interpret our results as suggesting that SNP-mediated increases in secreted, soluble clusterin expression may act to reduce AD risk.Methods Top Ethics StatementThe work described here was performed with approval from the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board.Cell CultureSH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma) and HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 - 95% air atmosphere.CLU Expression PlasmidExpression plasmids encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were generated from SH-SY5Y cellular mRNA that was reverse transcribed by using the primer 5\u2032-TAGGTGCAAAAGCAACAT-3\u2032 which corresponds to sequence just after the CLU stop codon. CLU1 and CLU2 cDNAs were then amplified by PCR with forward primers 5\u2032-TGAGTCATGCAGGTTTGCAG-3\u2032 (CLU1) and 5\u2032-ATGATGAAGACTCTGCTGCTG-3\u2032 (CLU2) used in combination with the common reverse primer 5\u2032-CTCCTCCCGGTGCTTTTTG-3\u2032. PCR fragments were ligated into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO T/A cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Clones encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were detected by PCR screening and clone integrity confirmed by sequencing.Human Autopsy TissueDe-identified human brain specimens were provided by the University of Kentucky AD Center Neuropathology Core [23], [24]. AD and non-AD designations followed NIARI neuropathology guidelines, which include indices of neuritic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and provide a likelihood staging of AD neuropathological diagnosis [25], [26]. Individuals with \u201clow\u201d AD neuropathology were cognitively intact prior to death and had no or low likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria; their average age at death was 81.8\u00b110.2 (mean \u00b1SD, n = 17). Individuals with \u201chigh\u201d AD neuropathology represented a combination of demented individuals with high likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria (n = 27) and cognitively intact individuals that were found to have moderate or high AD neuropathology at death (n = 7); their average age at death was 81.9\u00b16.2 (mean \u00b1SD, n = 34). The average post-mortem interval (PMI) for low AD neuropathology individuals was 3.0\u00b10.8 hours (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 17) while the PMI for high AD neuropathology individuals was similar (3.2\u00b10.8 hours (n = 34)). Choroid plexus samples were from six individuals with an average age at death of 80.0\u00b1 3.3 years and PMI of 2.9\u00b11.1 hours. Fetal tissue RNA samples were obtained commercially (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) and have been described previously [27].PCR AmplificationTotal RNA was extracted from human brain specimens and converted to cDNA in 1 \u00b5g aliquots with random hexamers and reverse transcriptase (SuperScript III, Invitrogen), essentially as we described previously [24], [28], [29], [30]. PCR primers were designed such that the splicing of each internal CLU exon as well as CLU1 and CLU2 were evaluated (Table 1). In initial screening, cDNA pooled from five high AD neuropathology and five low AD neuropathology samples were subjected to PCR-amplification (Platinum Taq, Invitrogen) by using each primer pair and a PCR profile consisting of initial denaturation for 5 minutes at 95\u00b0C, followed by 27\u201332 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min (Perkin Elmer 9600). PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, stained with SYBR Gold and visualized by using a fluorescence imager (Fuji FLA-2000). The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing (Davis Sequencing, Davis, CA).thumbnailTable 1. PCR Primers for evaluating splice variation.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.t001 Real-time PCRThe expression level of CLU1 and CLU2 was quantified by real-time PCR. Each isoform was specifically amplified by using a sense primer corresponding to sequence within their respective exon 1, i.e., 5\u2032-GCGAGCAGAGCGCTATAAAT-3\u2032 for CLU1 and 5\u2032-AGATGGATTCGGTGTGAAGG-3\u2032 for CLU2\u2032, and an antisense primer corresponding to sequence at the exon 2\u20133 boundary, i.e., 5\u2032-GACATTTCCTGGAGCTCATTG-3\u2032. Note that the CLU1 sense primer contains the TATA sequence suggested by Schepeler et al to be present only in a longer \u201cCLU34\u201d isoform [31]. The 20 \u00b5l real-time PCR mixture containing approximately 20 ng of brain cDNA, 1 \u00b5M of each primer and 1\u00d7 PerfecTaq PCRSupermix (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD) was subjected to real-time PCR (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). PCR profiles consisted of pre-incubation at 95\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 20 s. Specificity of the reactions was evaluated by showing a single PCR product by gel electrophoresis and by performing a melting curve analysis after PCR amplification. The PCR product copy number in each sample was determined relative to standard curves that were amplified in parallel and were based upon previously purified and quantified PCR products. The copy numbers were then normalized to the geometric mean of the copy numbers of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 and ribosomal protein L13A as described (Vandesompele et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2005). All real-time PCR assays were repeated twice.GenotypingDNA samples were genotyped for rs11136000 by using unlabeled PCR primers and TaqMan FAM and VIC dye-labeled MGB probes (Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on a real-time PCR machine (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).Statistical AnalysisVariation in CLU isoform expression were analyzed as a function of rs11136000 genotype, AD neuropathology, sex and age by using a general linear model (SPSS v.18 (IBM, Somers, NY)). A dominant mode of inheritance was assumed to maximize statistical power.ImmunofluorescenceCLU expression plasmids were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN). Briefly, 3.75\u00d7104 cells/well were maintained in a poly-L-lysine treated 8-well chamber coverglass (Lab-Tek, Nunc, Rochester, NY) and transfected the next day with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 minutes. Non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells with 5% goat serum in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) for 1 hour and the cells were then incubated with mouse anti-V5 antibody (1:1000 dilution, ab27671, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and either rabbit anti-calnexin antibody (1:200 dilution, SPA-860, Stressgen, Victoria, BC, Canada) or rabbit anti-TGN46 antibody (1:1000 dilution, ab16052, Abcam) in 5% goat serum at 4\u00b0C overnight. The next day, cells were washed with PBST three times and incubated with a mixture containing Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:200 dilution, Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) and Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:200 dilution, Molecular Probes) in 5% goat serum at room temperature for an hour. After washing with PBST, cells were stained with 10 \u00b5g/ml of Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes) for 30 minutes, washed with PBS, and subjected to fluorescence microscopy.Western BlotSH-SY5Y cells or HepG2 cells were grown in a 100 mm dish (2.6\u00d7106 cells/dish) for 24 hours and then transfected with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Sciences). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell medium was replaced with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and cells maintained for another 24 hours. The conditioned medium was collected and the cells washed with 5 ml of room-temperature PBS. Cells were then lysed in 0.5 ml of RIPA butter (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) containing 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Sciences) for 30 minutes on ice with occasional rocking. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C and the supernatant collected. Conditioned medium was centrifuged at 250\u00d7g for 10 minutes and 0.5 ml of the supernatant was collected and supplemented with 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science). Human brain anterior cingulate tissue samples were prepared by homogenizing ~0.5 mg tissue in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail, centrifuging at 14,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C, and then collecting the supernatant. After the protein concentration of each sample was determined (Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit, Pierce, Rockford, IL), 15 or 20 \u00b5g protein were mixed with SDS sample loading buffer containing \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 minutes and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The blots were then incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature and probed overnight with mouse anti-V5 antibody (1:5000 dilution, Abcam) or mouse anti-clusterin antibody (1:200, B-5 Santa-Cruz) at 4\u00b0C. After washing with PBST four times for 5 minutes each, the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (1:1,000 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 hour at room temperature. Bound peroxidase was visualized by using a SuperSignal West Pico kit (Pierce) and a molecular imager (ChemiDoc XRS System, Bio-Rad). For studies involving PNGase F digestion, each protein sample was treated with PNGase F as directed by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Briefly, 15 \u00b5g protein of each sample was denatured at 100\u00b0C for 10 minutes and incubated with 1,500 units of PNGase F at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours. Samples were then analyzed by Western blot as described above.Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression, we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain. Previously reported isoforms include CLU1 and CLU2, which are identical in exons 2\u20139 but differ in exon 1, as well as isoforms lacking exons 2 or 5 ([21], [22], reviewed in [20]). RT-PCR analyses of pooled human brain cDNA samples detected only CLU1 and CLU2 (Figure 1A\u20131B). CLU2 translation is predicted to result in a secreted protein, beginning at the initial ATG in exon 2 that is common to both CLU2 and CLU1 (Figure 1C). In contrast, CLU1 translation is predicted to initiate at an ATG within its exon 1, which is in-frame with the ATG site in the common exon 2. Hence, CLU1 is predicted to encode a protein identical to that encoded by CLU2 except that the CLU1 protein would contain 52 additional amino acids at its amino terminus (Figure 1C). This change is predicted by PSORTII to result in an intracellular and likely nuclear, form of clusterin (reviewed in [20]). In summary, CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in brain and are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively.thumbnailFigure 1. CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms expressed in human brain.The exon layout for the CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms is shown (A). Coding and non-coding exonic regions are represented by black and white boxes, respectively, while introns are shown as thin black lines. The first ATG site in each isoform is shown as well. Evaluation of CLU splicing by RT-PCR identified only CLU1 and CLU2 in human brain cDNA (B), i.e., single PCR products are observed upon amplification from exon 1a \u2013 exon 5 (lane 1), exon 1b \u2013 exon 5 (lane 2), exon 4 \u2013 exon 6 (lane 3) and exon 5 \u2013 exon 9 (lane 4). Molecular weight markers are shown at the left. The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2, beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A, are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2. The boxed amino acid sequence represents signal sequence that is removed from clusterin-2 upon its translocation to the ER. Two nuclear localization sequences, as predicted by PSORT II (http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form2.htm l), are underlined. The asterisk shows the clusterin cleavage site that separates the \u03b1- and \u03b2- subunits.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.g001 To evaluate whether rs11136000, the primary AD-related CLU SNP [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], is associated with CLU expression, we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 expression in a series of brain samples. The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2\u20133 boundary. Copy numbers were determined relative to a standard curve for each isoform and normalized to the geometric mean of housekeeping genes [23], [32]. The expression of CLU1 and CLU2 were modestly coordinately regulated (Figure 2A), with CLU2 being consistently greater than CLU1; the overall CLU2: CLU1 ratio was 3.35\u00b11.84 (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 51). To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression, we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples (Figure 2B). Among the fetal tissues, the CLU2: CLU1 ratio varied widely from 0.3 (skin) to 6.2 (kidney) (Figure 2B). The CLU2:CLU1 ratio in choroid plexus, which produces cerebrospinal fluid, was 5.72\u00b10.65 (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 6).thumbnailFigure 2. Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues.CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms were quantified by isoform-specific RT-PCR in a series of adult human cingulate and choroid plexus samples (A\u2013B) as well as a human fetal tissues (B). Within A, each marker reflects the expression of CLU1 and CLU2, normalized to housekeeping genes, in a single brain sample. Within B, the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1:CLU2 ratio. CLU1 expression shows a positive association with AD neuropathology and rs11136000T allele (C). CLU2 expression was increased in individuals with AD pathology and decreased with age (D\u2013E).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.g002 We next evaluated CLU isoform expression as a function of AD neuropathology, rs11136000 status, sex and age. We found that CLU1 expression was significantly increased with high AD neuropathology and the minor rs11136000T allele (Figure 2C, Table 2). In contrast, CLU2 expression was significantly increased with AD neuropathology but not rs11136000 genotype, and decreased with age (Figure 2D\u2013E, Table 3). Overall, both CLU1 and CLU2 expression was increased with AD, confirming prior reports. However, only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000. Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk.thumbnailTable 2. Analysis of CLU1 Expression.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.t002 thumbnailTable 3. Analysis of CLU2 Expression.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.t003 CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively (Figure 1). Therefore, we evaluated the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to discern whether these corresponded to the intracellular and secreted forms of clusterin that have been reported [4], [8], [33]. When each isoform was transiently transfected into neural SH-SY5Y cells, immunofluorescence analyses showed a similar subcellular localization pattern (Figure 3). The proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 tended to concentrate within the Golgi apparatus, as established by double-labeling with an antibody against trans-Golgi network protein 46 (TGN46) (Figure 3A). Relatively modest amounts of clusterin were also detected within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as established by double labeling with calnexin (Figure 3B). Nuclear, cytosolic, or mitochondrial-associated clusterin was not observed. Hence, the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 manifests an intracellular localization that includes the ER and Golgi, consistent with a possible secretory pathway for both proteins.thumbnailFigure 3. CLU1 and CLU2 encoded proteins are localized to the ER and Golgi.SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with vectors encoding CLU1 and CLU2; the resultant clusterin expression was localized by a vector-derived V5 epitope tag. The subcellular localization for both proteins overlapped with the Golgi, as shown by co-labeling with antibody against TGN46 (A) and with the ER, as shown by co-labeling with an antibody against calnexin (B).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.g003 CLU1 is predicted to encode a 501 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 57.8 kDa while CLU2 is predicted to encode 449 amino acids, totaling 52.5 kDa. During maturation of secreted clusterin, the protein is N-glycosylated and proteolyzed to generate a heterodimer that is maintained by disulfide bonds [20]. To compare the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2, we performed Western blot analyses of transfected SH-SY5Y cells; ectopic clusterin was detected via a V5 epitope tag (Figure 4 A\u2013B). Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size (Figure 4A). To discern whether glycosylation differences may obscure differences in the clusterin molecular weight derived from their primary sequence, the protein mixtures were digested with PNGase F to remove N-linked sugars prior to electrophoresis; the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells were both decreased similarly by PNGase treatment (Figure 4B). We considered the possibility that CLU translation may show cell-type specificity, and therefore repeated this study in an unrelated cell line by transfecting CLU1 and CLU2 into HepG2 cells. As with the SH-SY5Y cells, CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells produced clusterin of similar size, even after PNGase F digestion (Figure 4C). Hence, we found no evidence to suggest that the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 differ in cellular localization, size, glycosylation, or proteolytic cleavage. Rather, when these Western blot studies are considered in combination with the immunofluorescence studies, CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce equivalent proteins that are similarly translated, glycosylated, and cleaved as they pass through the ER and Golgi in the secretory pathway to the extracellular space.thumbnailFigure 4. CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.Transfection of CLU1 and CLU2 resulted in proteins of similar size, appearing as both intact and cleaved clusterin in cell lysates and conditioned media; the proteins resulting from CLU transfection were detected via their V5 epitope tag (A\u2013B). PNGase F treatment prior to electrophoresis reduced the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 similarly (B). The apparent doublet in the protein encoded by CLU1 at 37 kDa was variable between experiments and likely reflects incomplete glycosylation as the doublet collapsed to a single band after PNGase F digestion. Results similar to those depicted in B were obtained when CLU1 and CLU2 were transfected into HepG2 cells (C). When transfected and endogenous clusterin proteins were detected with an antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal clusterin epitope (D\u2013E), intact clusterin from transfection (T-labeled arrow) was slightly larger than endogenous clusterin (E-labeled arrow), reflecting the ~5.1 kDa V5 epitope and His tags in the ectopic clusterin (D). The bands labeled \u201cFragments\u201d are clusterin alpha subunits derived from variably glycosylated endogenous and transfected clusterin. Overall, the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin, as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions (D) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions (E).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo, we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody. Endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells migrates at a slightly lower molecular weight than that resulting from CLU transfection, reflecting the 5.1 kDa V5/His tag encoded by the pcDNA3.1 vector expressing transfected CLU (Figure 4D). Importantly, this 5.1 kDa size difference between endogenous and transfected clusterin is similar to the size difference between the CLU1 and CLU2-predicted proteins, indicating that if the proteins encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 differed by 5 kDa, the proteins would be resolved easily under these experimental conditions. The endogenous SH-SY5Y clusterin migrates similarly to the intact protein detected in brain homogenates suggesting these cellular forms are similar to those present in vivo (Figure 4D). To extend this analysis to the heterodimeric form of clusterin, we also performed electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions. We found that heterodimeric protein from CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells appeared similar in size to each other and to the forms found in brain (Figure 4E). Hence, CLU1 and CLU2 produce proteins in vitro that are similar in size to endogenous clusterin in vitro and human brain.Discussion Top The main findings of this report are several. First, CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in human brain and differ in their first exon and proximal promoter. Second, the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology. Third, CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain. Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele, which is also associated with reduced AD risk, we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk. Overall, these results identify a possible means underlying the association of rs11136000 with AD risk.The association between CLU expression and rs11136000 was discerned because the CLU isoforms were analyzed separately. For example, when we analyzed total CLU expression in the same fashion as reported here, total CLU was not associated with rs11136000 (p = 0.51) although a robust association with AD pathology was observed (p = 0.005, Ling et al., unpublished observations). The lack of a significant association between rs11136000 and total CLU is somewhat disconcerting since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce a similar protein. We speculate that (i) the threshold for clusterin biological significance may be less than the threshold for overall CLU statistical significance and/or (ii) CLU1 may be enriched in a cell type different than CLU2, which may affect its functionality. We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [17], [34]. As the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appears similar, discerning an association between rs11136000 and clusterin would be especially challenging in tissues with a large proportion of CLU2. In this regard, CLU2 was the major isoform in choroid plexus, suggesting that an association between cerebrospinal fluid clusterin and rs11136000 would be difficult to detect. The differential regulation of CLU1 and CLU2 was not unexpected because CLU1 and CLU2 have separate proximal promoter regions. Consistent with this observation, Cochrane et al found that androgen-treatment in a prostate cancer cell line decreased CLU1 expression while enhancing CLU2 expression [35]. Although the identification of the functional SNPs and transcription factors that modulate CLU expression is beyond the scope of this report, we note that rs11136000 resides within intron 3 and is common to both CLU1 and CLU2. Hence, rs11136000 is likely not functional but rather is in linkage with a functional SNP more proximal to the CLU1 promoter. In summary, the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately.Since earlier predictions were that CLU2 encodes a secreted protein while the additional 52 amino-terminal residues encoded by CLU1 would result in its intracellular localization [20], we expected clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to differ in cellular locale and size. In support of this prediction, the ATG translation initiation sites in the CLU1-specific exon 1a as well as the common exon 2 both satisfy Kozak consensus sequence requirements (http://bioinfo.iitk.ac.in/AUGPred/). However, clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells was localized to the secretory pathway and was equivalent in size under conditions that would easily discern their predicted five kDa size difference, especially after PNGase F treatment to remove sugar residues. Hence, CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro. Comparable results were obtained in two cell types, suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein. The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG. The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded. Distinguishing among these possibilities is a future direction for this work. Overall, we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other, and similar in size to those present in human brain, leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo.A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk. Furthermore, since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease, we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset, mimicking the likely SNP effects. One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [35]. Stress has also been shown to upregulate CLU in many instances [36] and may cause the AD-associated increase in CLU observed here. In terms of possible therapeutic agents, multiple histone deacetylase inhibitors increase CLU expression robustly in vitro [37]. Interestingly, one member of this class, valproate, increases CLU expression in human astrocytes [37] and reduces amyloid accumulation as well as behavioral deficits in mouse amyloid models [38], [39]. While valproate may also act via other mechanisms [38], the actions of valproate on CLU expression may be relevant to its neuroprotection and merit further exploration to reduce AD risk.Limitations of this study include that rs11136000 and AD neuropathological status capture only ~20% of the variance in CLU expression. Identifying the unknown factors that account for the additional variance, which could include epigenetic factors, will facilitate understanding of CLU expression. Moreover, variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here, suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community. Additionally, since the nuclear form of clusterin arising from an isoform lacking exon 2 has been associated with apoptosis [21], [22], this isoform may be transiently expressed and hence below our limits of detection, especially in comparison with CLU1 and CLU2.In conclusion, the AD-protective allele of rs11136000 was associated with increased expression of CLU1 but not CLU2 in our dataset. Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble, secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain. Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately.Acknowledgments Top The authors gratefully acknowledge tissue supplied by the University of Kentucky AD Center and Ishita Parikh for technical assistance.Author Contributions Top Conceived and designed the experiments: IL SE.

Insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting A\u03b2, and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy. We show that the active form of somatostatin-14 regulates IDE activity by affecting its expression and secretion in microglia cells. A similar effect can also be observed when adding octreotide. Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE, here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A\u03b2 catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments. As a whole, these data indicate the relevant role played by somatostatin and, potentially, by analogue octreotide, in preventing A\u03b2 accumulation by partially restoring IDE activity.Citation: Tundo G, Ciaccio C, Sbardella D, Boraso M, Viviani B, et al.

Although molecular basis of AD remains largely unclear, there is considerable evidence which supports the so-called \u201camyloid cascade hypothesis\u201d: AD may be viewed as a metabolic vicious cycle in which \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition into senile plaques drives neurodegeneration by triggering abnormal microglia activation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation and the consequent death of astrocytes and neurons. A\u03b2 accumulation in the brain is the result of the imbalance between its biosynthesis and removal [2], [3]. Several proteases, such as insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE), neprilysin (NEP) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are involved in A\u03b2 degradation [4]\u2013[6]. In this regard, a decrease in A\u03b2-degrading enzymes expression or activity, as a result of genetic factors, age and environmental conditions, may be a crucial aspect in AD pathogenesis [7]. Notably, IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates, including insulin, amylin, glucagon, atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [8]. Even though its role in the onset of AD is not yet to be completely understood [5], the relevance of IDE in AD pathogenesis has been validated in works which have mapped the IDE gene on chromosome 10 [9], [10], making it a candidate gene for the AD-6 locus. Furthermore, it has been shown that, during aging, IDE decreases in the brain of AD patients [11]\u2013[13]. Additionally, several studies underline a link between IDE haplotypes and SNPs in the IDE gene, associating them to AD [14]\u2013[16]. We have recently demonstrated that somatostatin (sst) is a substrate and an allosteric modulator of IDE activity, which enhances the proteolytic processing of a synthetic A\u03b2-peptide [17]. Somatostatin depletion in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients is directly connected to memory and learning impairment [18]\u2013[20] and a strong reduction of sst-expressing neurons in the mouse CA1 hippocampal region seems to be associated to the onset of AD [21]. Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [22]. Although molecular mechanisms coupling somatostatin depletion and AD remain unclear, somatostatin transmitter replacement has been identified as a potential pharmacological strategy for AD prevention [23], [24]. Furthermore, the activation of somatostatin neurotransmission by sst-releasing agents, such as FK960 and FK962, has been shown to significantly improve cognitive performances in animal models [25], [26]. On the other hand, although in the past, the use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide in clinical trials has not been unequivocally associated to the restoration of cognitive functions, there is some evidence which seems to demonstrate its potential therapeutic value [24], [27]. Since microglia secretes A\u03b2 and IDE [28], [29] and displays three functionally active receptor subtypes for somatostatin (sst) (i.e. Receptors type 2, 3 and 4) [30], [31], we investigated sst effect on IDE expression in microglia cells. In this work, we show that in activated microglia, somatostatin regulates IDE expression, secretion and proteolytic activity toward A\u03b2, which suggests that somatostatin pathological depletion could be one of the key events leading to A\u03b2 deposition.Materials and Methods Top MaterialsMouse BV-2 microglial cells were kindly provided by Prof. D. Rosato (University of Perugia, Italy) and N9 cells by Prof. R. Ciccarelli (University of Chieti, Italy) [32], [33]. Octreotide was a generous gift from Italfarmaco. RPMI 1640, fetal bovine serum, L-glutammine, penicillin, streptomycin, sodium pyruvate and ciprofloxacin were purchased from Euro Clone (Life Sciences Division, Italy). Minimum essential Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, trypsin 2.5%, DNAse 1%, glucose, streptomycin, penicillin, L-glutammine, L-leucine methyl ester were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human somatostatin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA); recombinant insulin degrading-enzyme was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA); \u03b2-amyloid (1\u201340) was obtained from Anaspec (San Jose, CA, USA). An IDE siRNA SmartPool and a non-specific control pool were synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA). Each pool contains four individual siRNA duplex sequences. Lipofectamine and OptiMEM medium were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). A \u03b2-amyloid(1\u201340) Elisa kit was obtained from IBL-Humburg (Hamburg, Germany); an RNasy Plus micro kit for RNA isolation was obtained from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) and a Masterscript kit and SYBER ROX Master Mix came from 5PRIME (Humburg, Germany). All other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich.Methods Top Cell culture. BV-2, a murine microglial cell line, was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutammine (2 mM), penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 \u00b5g/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mM) and ciprofloxacin (0.03 mM). Cells were seeded on 96-well plates (1\u00d7104/well) and grown overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2[32].Astrocytes and microglia cell cultures. Primary cultures of glial cells were prepared from 2-day-old newborn rats (Sprague\u2013Dawley, Charles River, Calco, Italy). Cerebral hemispheres were freed of the meninges and were mechanically disrupted. Cells were dissociated in a solution of trypsin 2.5% and DNAse 1%, filtered through a 100-\u00b5m nylon mesh, and plated in a 75 cm2 flask (5\u00d7106/flask) in minimum essential Eagle's medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glucose (0.6%), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), penicillin (100 IU/ml) and L-glutammine (2 mM). Glial cultures were fed twice a week and grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. A layer of astrocytic cells was obtained through the vigorous shaking of a confluent 10-day-old monolayer of mixed glial cells [34]. Cultures of enriched astroglia were treated further with 5 mM L-leucine methyl ester to eliminate microglia (97% homogeneity). Isolated astroglial preparations were then seeded in 96-well plates (6\u00d7104/well) in MEM with supplements as above. Microglia were isolated by shaking glial cultures at 260 rpm for 2 hrs. Microglia which dislodged into the medium were purified by plating for 30 min in 96-well plates (6\u00d7104/well). Contaminating cells were removed with supernatant. These conditions allowed us to obtain highly enriched microglial cultures with 98% homogeneity, as assessed by immunocytochemistry with Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4.All animal protocols have been performed to Department of Pharmacological Sciences, University of Milan. The experiments were designed so as to minimize the number of animals used. Animal protocols for these studies have been approved for Department of Pharmacological Sciences by the Ministry of Health and were conducted with minimal suffering of the animals and strictly following European Community (ECC Directive no. 609/86) and local (Italian legislative Decree no. 116, January 27, 1992) regulations for animal care. All animal care procedures were in accordance with the local Animal Care Committee, and no weight loss or death was observed after we had received them in our animal facility.Treatment and sample preparation. Indicated concentrations of somatostatin (dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.3) were added to the cell culture medium on the day after plating. Stimulation was carried out overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Supernatants of stimulated and nonstimulated cells were collected and frozen at \u221220\u00b0C until use, while the monolayers were lysed in a solubilization buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail with broad specificity for the inhibtion of serine, cysteine, aspartic and aminopeptidases (from Sigma-Aldrich).Qualitative Insulin-degrading-enzyme analysis by Western Blotting. Total protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by a Bradford assay [35]. 10 \u00b5g of each sample were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred on Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Membranes were blocked in a PBS Tween (T-PBS) 0.01%, 5% fat-free milk solution, then probed with IDE rabbit polyclonal antibody BC2 (Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA, 1:3000 in T-PBS-0.1% and incubated with an Horse Radish Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA, 1:50000 in T-PBS 0.2% fatty free milk). Immunoreactive signals were detected with an ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis was performed by Image Quant TL program.Secreted IDE quantification in BV-2 cell supernatants by ELISA. IDE goat polyclonal antibody K-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was diluted in PBS 1\u00d7 and coated on a microtiter plate at a final concentration of 0.5 \u00b5g/ml. Unsaturated binding sites were blocked in T-PBS-0.01% 5% fat-free milk solution before exposure to BV-2 cell supernatants. An IDE rabbit polyclonal antibody BC2 (1:3000in T-PBS 0.01%) and a Horse Radish Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:50000 in T-PBS 0.2% fat-free milk) were used for IDE quantification. IDE concentration was determined by using a TMB colorimetric kit according to product instructions. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm in a microtiter plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). A standard curve was performed by using known concentrations of recombinant IDE (Calbiochem).Quantitative real-time PCR. The total RNA from each sample of BV-2 cells was isolated using an RNeasy Plus micro kit for RNA isolation according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA of total RNA was generated in two reaction volumes of Masterscript kit using random hexamers. Real-time PCR was performed by SDS7700 (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) with Manual SYBER ROX Master Mix. GAPDH was measured as the internal control. Primer sequences were: ACGAGGCTATACGTCCAAGATTG and ATTGCCACCCGCACATTTT (Forward and Reverse, respectively) for IDE; AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG and CACATTGGGGGTAGGAACAC (Forward and Reverse, respectively) for GAPDH. The following cycles were performed: initial denaturation cycle at 95\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s, at 58\u00b0C for 30 s and at 68\u00b0C for 30 s.Analysis of MMP-9 in Zymography and Western Blotting. Aliquots of supernatants from cell culture samples were run under non-reducing denaturant conditions on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/mL gelatine (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), soaked twice in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min and then incubated for 18 hrs in the developing buffer (20 mM Tris, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4). For visualization purposes, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained with 10% acetic acid and 20% methanol solution. For the Western blotting analysis of MMP-9 in cell lysates, 10 \u00b5g of whole cell lysate were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a Hybond nitrocellulose membrane. Non-specific sites were blocked with a 0.025% T-PBS 5% fat-free milk solution and filters were then probed with a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, CO 1:2000 in 0.1% T-PBS) and thereafter with a Horse Radish Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, (1:50000 in T-PBS 0.2% fat-free milk). Immunoreactive signals were detected with an ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences).IDE siRNA Transfection. BV-2 cells were used for transfection when 30%\u201340% confluent in order to obtain the greatest transfection efficiency. Cells were transfected with 20 pmol of IDE-siRNA or siRNA control pool using Lipofectamine in OptiMEM media according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Somatostatin stimulation was performed 48 h after transfection.\u00df-amyloid(1\u201340) quantification in BV-2 conditioned medium with sandwich ELISA. Human somatostatin was added at different concentrations to the culture medium of control and IDE-siRNA transfected BV-2 cells. According to the manufacturer's instructions, the incubation was carried out for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and the supernatants collected for \u03b2-amyloid(1\u201340) quantification by ELISA. Equal volumes of each sample were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on plates pre-coated with anti-A\u03b2 (35\u201340) Mouse IgG. HRP conjugated anti-mouse A\u03b2(1\u201316) rabbit IgG was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. Reactivity was developed with TMB for 30 min at room temperature and stopped with 1 N H2SO4. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a microtiter plate reader. A standard curve was obtained with A\u03b2(1\u201340).Statistical analysis. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine significant differences among groups. Tukey's honestly significant difference post hoc test was used for pair wise comparisons after the analysis of variance.Results Top Somatostatin modulation of IDE expressionBV-2 cells as well as primary rat microglia were stimulated with different sst concentrations and the IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of incubation. As shown in Figure 1, sst increases IDE expression in primary (A) and BV-2 cells (B). Since sst half life in the serum is short [36], the same sst concentration was re-added 6 hrs after the first administration. This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression (Figure 1). It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression (data not shown). In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic, rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well (SSTR-1, SSTR-2, and SSTR-4) [37] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations (Figure S1). IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1, no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed.thumbnailFigure 1. Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells.Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples from rat primary microglia (A) and BV-2 (B) indicates that IDE level increases after 24 hrs of somatostatin incubation, while the internal control \u00df-tubulin is constant. The additional incubation with sst after 6 hrs from first round strengthens the effect on IDE expression (left panel).

The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a RealTime-PCR. A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs, suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells (Figure 2A).thumbnailFigure 2. Somatostatin modulation on IDE level in BV-2 cells.(A) IDE mRNA increases after 5 hrs of incubation with somatostatin (white columns); 24 hrs after incubation, the level is similar to the control (grey columns). Basal mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR in individual preparations of BV2. Data were first normalized against GAPDH and then expressed setting the value measured in controls at 1. The results presented are the means \u00b1 ES (B) Elisa analysis of conditioned medium indicates that IDE level increases in BV-2 cells after 24 hrs of incubation as a function of somatostatin concentration. The results presented are the means \u00b1 SEs of five independent experiments in triplicate. P<0.05, one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test, n = 15.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretionIt is known that a small fraction of IDE (ranging from 3% to 10%) is secreted into the extracellular space, where it presumably interacts with its substrates, such as insulin and \u03b2-amyloid [8], [38]. In order to determine whether, besides inducing synthesis, sst also stimulates IDE secretion, the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration. As reported in Figure 2B, the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR (Figue 1B and 2A). This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression, but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space.Somatostatin effect on MMP-9 activityIn addition to their ability to phagocyte \u03b2-amyloid, microglia can also clear A\u03b2 by degradation through the production of A\u03b2-degrading enzymes, such as IDE, neprilysin and MMP-9 [29], [33], [39]. Therefore, we assessed whether sst is involved in the regulation of MMP-9 level. For this purpose, BV-2 cells were stimulated with different sst concentrations and MMP-9 activity was measured by zymographyc analysis (Figure 3A). No detectable modulation of MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was observed for each experimental condition. Qualitative analysis of MMP-9 content was further performed on total cell lysates. A polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band around 92 kDa, corresponding to the pro-MMP-9, which is constant over the different sst concentrations (Figure 3B). This result rules out any involvement of sst in the modulation of MMP-9 expression, secretion and activity.thumbnailFigure 3. Effect of somatostatin on MMP-9 expression.(A) Zymographyc analysis of cell culture supernatants harvested after 24 hrs of incubation indicate that somatostain administration does not modulate gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 in each of the experimental conditions. (B) In Western blotting analysis of cell lysates a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 (92 kDa) which is not modulated over each experimental condition. Analysis of \u03b2-tubulin represents the internal control. The results presented are the means \u00b1 ES of three indipendent experiments in triplicate, n = 9.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g003 Octreotide modulation of IDE expressionRecently, somatostatin transmitter replacement has been viewed as a potential AD therapeutical strategy [24], [40]. In this regard, BV-2 cells were stimulated with octreotide, a long-acting octapeptide somatostatin analogue commonly used in clinical trials, in order to verify the effect on the expression pattern of IDE [41]. 0.1\u201310 \u00b5M octreotide induces a dose-dependent increase of IDE expression (Figure 4A) in a similar way to what can be observed in the presence of somatostatin (Figure 1). A similar result can also be obtained for IDE secretion, by using an ELISA assay on BV-2 cell supernatants collected 24 hrs after the administration (Figure 4B). Therefore, these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells (see Figures 1, 2 and 4).thumbnailFigure 4. Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion.(A) WB (left panel) and densitometric analysis of IDE (right panel) after 24 hrs incubation with the indicated concentrations of octreotide. (B) ELISA analysis on BV-2 medium after octreotide incubation reveals that the sst analogue induces IDE secretion. In every case, the results presented are the means \u00b1 ES of four independent experiments in triplicate. * P<0.05, oneway ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test, n = 12.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g004 Somatostatin regulation of A\u03b2(1\u201340) degradation by insulin-degrading-enzymeWe have previously shown that somatostatin is an IDE substrate and an allosteric modulator of recombinant IDE enzymatic activity toward a fluorogenic \u03b2-peptide [17]. Therefore, we aimed to verify whether sst by allosteric modulation of endogenous IDE could affect the clearance of the A\u03b2 peptide secreted by BV-2 cells. To this purpose, IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach. At the maximum rate of IDE silencing (corresponding to about 60%\u201370%, see Figure 5A), different somatostatin concentrations (ranging between 0.01 \u00b5M and 0.5 \u00b5M) were added to the culture medium of both silenced and non-silenced cells. A\u03b2(1\u201340) was quantified in cell supernatants after 1 h of somatostatin stimulation, a time interval during which there was no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE, a fact that was demonstrated through Western Blotting analysis on cell lysates (data not shown). A\u03b2(1\u201340) concentration was slightly reduced at sst 0.01 \u00b5M in both silenced and not-silenced cells. In spite of this, A\u03b2(1\u201340) concentration was not further altered in the medium of silenced cells by increasing sst concentrations, while it was progressively reduced in the medium of non-silenced cells (Figure 5B), suggesting that the reduction of A\u03b2 observed at sst 0.01 in silenced cells could be due to the effect of sst on residual IDE. Therefore, at physiological concentrations, sst modulates IDE activity also by promoting A\u03b2(1\u201340) degradation in the BV-2 cells supernatants.thumbnailFigure 5. Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent A\u03b2 degradation.(A) BV-2 cells transfected with a specific IDE siRNA pool show reduced levels of IDE protein, compared to cells transfected with a nonspecific control siRNA pool (right panel). (B) A\u03b2(1\u201340) quantification through sandwich ELISA reveals that the levels of A\u03b2 are drastically reduced in the presence of IDE steady level (grey columns) compared to IDE-silencing samples (white columns).

In this regard, the extracellular A\u03b2 degrading enzymes (such as IDE, MMP-9 and NEP) are now considered promising therapeutic targets for AD treatment [33]. Notably, IDE is the main extracellular protease secreted by microglia involved in A\u03b2 degradation, even though the molecular basis of IDE regulation are poorly known [5]. Microglia seems to cover a two-fold role in AD pathogenesis. Firstly, early microglia activation exerts a neuroprotective effect by promoting A\u03b2 clearance. Secondly, as the disease progresses, the microglia A\u03b2-clearing capability is compromised [38], [41]. This downregulation is followed by an increase of A\u03b2 released by neurons and by a worsening of the disease [32]. We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [17]. In this work, we further study the effect of sst on IDE showing that the neuropeptide somatostatin also specifically regulates IDE, the main extracellular A\u03b2 protease, by affecting its expression and secretion in both primary and BV-2 microglia cells. Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate: IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation, returning to the basal level within 24 hrs, whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times, being still clearly evident after 24 hrs. Through this pathway, somatostatin enhances IDE secretion, strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with \u03b2-amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates. This effect is specific for IDE since sst does not affect either secretion and activity of MMP-9, another enzyme which is active in A\u03b2 degradation. It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [3], [20]. It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of \u03b2-amyloid in the brain. In addition, since the A\u03b2 chronic accumulation triggers a further reduction in sst level [18], all these events could represent a vicious cycle which ultimately favors A\u03b2 plaque formations. As matter of fact, somatostatinergic transmitter replacement is a potentially viable strategy in the treatment of AD, even though the pharmacological restoration of this deficit has not been unequivocally associated to a recovery of normal cognitive performances [24], [26], [40]. In this framework, we tested the octreotide effect on IDE expression, a somatostatin analogue currently used in the treatment of acromegaly, pituitary adenomes and pancreatic tumors [41], [42]. Here, we show that, like somatostatin, octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion, although the effects are generally reduced compared to the endogenous modulator. Somatostatin binds all five receptor subtypes with high affinity, whereas octreotide is a selective agonist, binding to receptor subtypes 2 and 5 with high affinity (but lower than somatostatin) and with moderate affinity to subtype 3 [41]. Therefore, this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression, even though additional factors cannot be ruled out. Interestingly, we also observed that in astrocytes, incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression, reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells. This discrepancy is probably due to the different expression pattern of sst receptor on microglia (i.e. SSTR-2, SSTR-3, and SSTR-4) and astrocytes (i.e. SSTR-1, SSTR-2, and SSTR-4) [31], [35]. In our previous work, we reported that somatostatin is an allosteric modulator of IDE enzymatic activity on a fluorogenic A\u03b2-peptide [17]. Here, we show that somatostatin addition to the culture medium of BV-2 cells rapidly affects the amyloid \u03b2-peptide (1\u201340) extracellular concentration: after 1 h of stimulation (a time interval over which there is no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE), we observe a negative correlation between A\u03b2 concentration and sst concentration. The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in A\u03b2 levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration. As a whole, the reported data indicate that somatostatin regulates IDE expression, secretion and catalytic activity in microglia. These results are intriguing, considering that a microglia pharmacological manipulation is thought to play a neuroprotective role at least in the early stages of AD, since these cells cluster around senile plaques promoting A\u03b2 phagocytosis and degradation [3], [40], [43]. Therefore, a correlation can be envisaged between the regulation of IDE activity and the microglial immunological function during the development of AD, opening a new therapeutic scenario for the control of AD in the early phases.Supporting Information Top Figure S1.

Insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting A\u03b2, and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy. We show that the active form of somatostatin-14 regulates IDE activity by affecting its expression and secretion in microglia cells. A similar effect can also be observed when adding octreotide. Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE, here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A\u03b2 catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments. As a whole, these data indicate the relevant role played by somatostatin and, potentially, by analogue octreotide, in preventing A\u03b2 accumulation by partially restoring IDE activity.Citation: Tundo G, Ciaccio C, Sbardella D, Boraso M, Viviani B, et al.

Although molecular basis of AD remains largely unclear, there is considerable evidence which supports the so-called \u201camyloid cascade hypothesis\u201d: AD may be viewed as a metabolic vicious cycle in which \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition into senile plaques drives neurodegeneration by triggering abnormal microglia activation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation and the consequent death of astrocytes and neurons. A\u03b2 accumulation in the brain is the result of the imbalance between its biosynthesis and removal [2], [3]. Several proteases, such as insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE), neprilysin (NEP) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are involved in A\u03b2 degradation [4]\u2013[6]. In this regard, a decrease in A\u03b2-degrading enzymes expression or activity, as a result of genetic factors, age and environmental conditions, may be a crucial aspect in AD pathogenesis [7]. Notably, IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates, including insulin, amylin, glucagon, atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [8]. Even though its role in the onset of AD is not yet to be completely understood [5], the relevance of IDE in AD pathogenesis has been validated in works which have mapped the IDE gene on chromosome 10 [9], [10], making it a candidate gene for the AD-6 locus. Furthermore, it has been shown that, during aging, IDE decreases in the brain of AD patients [11]\u2013[13]. Additionally, several studies underline a link between IDE haplotypes and SNPs in the IDE gene, associating them to AD [14]\u2013[16]. We have recently demonstrated that somatostatin (sst) is a substrate and an allosteric modulator of IDE activity, which enhances the proteolytic processing of a synthetic A\u03b2-peptide [17]. Somatostatin depletion in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients is directly connected to memory and learning impairment [18]\u2013[20] and a strong reduction of sst-expressing neurons in the mouse CA1 hippocampal region seems to be associated to the onset of AD [21]. Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [22]. Although molecular mechanisms coupling somatostatin depletion and AD remain unclear, somatostatin transmitter replacement has been identified as a potential pharmacological strategy for AD prevention [23], [24]. Furthermore, the activation of somatostatin neurotransmission by sst-releasing agents, such as FK960 and FK962, has been shown to significantly improve cognitive performances in animal models [25], [26]. On the other hand, although in the past, the use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide in clinical trials has not been unequivocally associated to the restoration of cognitive functions, there is some evidence which seems to demonstrate its potential therapeutic value [24], [27]. Since microglia secretes A\u03b2 and IDE [28], [29] and displays three functionally active receptor subtypes for somatostatin (sst) (i.e. Receptors type 2, 3 and 4) [30], [31], we investigated sst effect on IDE expression in microglia cells. In this work, we show that in activated microglia, somatostatin regulates IDE expression, secretion and proteolytic activity toward A\u03b2, which suggests that somatostatin pathological depletion could be one of the key events leading to A\u03b2 deposition.Materials and Methods Top MaterialsMouse BV-2 microglial cells were kindly provided by Prof. D. Rosato (University of Perugia, Italy) and N9 cells by Prof. R. Ciccarelli (University of Chieti, Italy) [32], [33]. Octreotide was a generous gift from Italfarmaco. RPMI 1640, fetal bovine serum, L-glutammine, penicillin, streptomycin, sodium pyruvate and ciprofloxacin were purchased from Euro Clone (Life Sciences Division, Italy). Minimum essential Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, trypsin 2.5%, DNAse 1%, glucose, streptomycin, penicillin, L-glutammine, L-leucine methyl ester were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human somatostatin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA); recombinant insulin degrading-enzyme was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA); \u03b2-amyloid (1\u201340) was obtained from Anaspec (San Jose, CA, USA). An IDE siRNA SmartPool and a non-specific control pool were synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA). Each pool contains four individual siRNA duplex sequences. Lipofectamine and OptiMEM medium were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). A \u03b2-amyloid(1\u201340) Elisa kit was obtained from IBL-Humburg (Hamburg, Germany); an RNasy Plus micro kit for RNA isolation was obtained from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) and a Masterscript kit and SYBER ROX Master Mix came from 5PRIME (Humburg, Germany). All other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich.Methods Top Cell culture. BV-2, a murine microglial cell line, was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutammine (2 mM), penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 \u00b5g/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mM) and ciprofloxacin (0.03 mM). Cells were seeded on 96-well plates (1\u00d7104/well) and grown overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2[32].Astrocytes and microglia cell cultures. Primary cultures of glial cells were prepared from 2-day-old newborn rats (Sprague\u2013Dawley, Charles River, Calco, Italy). Cerebral hemispheres were freed of the meninges and were mechanically disrupted. Cells were dissociated in a solution of trypsin 2.5% and DNAse 1%, filtered through a 100-\u00b5m nylon mesh, and plated in a 75 cm2 flask (5\u00d7106/flask) in minimum essential Eagle's medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glucose (0.6%), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), penicillin (100 IU/ml) and L-glutammine (2 mM). Glial cultures were fed twice a week and grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. A layer of astrocytic cells was obtained through the vigorous shaking of a confluent 10-day-old monolayer of mixed glial cells [34]. Cultures of enriched astroglia were treated further with 5 mM L-leucine methyl ester to eliminate microglia (97% homogeneity). Isolated astroglial preparations were then seeded in 96-well plates (6\u00d7104/well) in MEM with supplements as above. Microglia were isolated by shaking glial cultures at 260 rpm for 2 hrs. Microglia which dislodged into the medium were purified by plating for 30 min in 96-well plates (6\u00d7104/well). Contaminating cells were removed with supernatant. These conditions allowed us to obtain highly enriched microglial cultures with 98% homogeneity, as assessed by immunocytochemistry with Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4.All animal protocols have been performed to Department of Pharmacological Sciences, University of Milan. The experiments were designed so as to minimize the number of animals used. Animal protocols for these studies have been approved for Department of Pharmacological Sciences by the Ministry of Health and were conducted with minimal suffering of the animals and strictly following European Community (ECC Directive no. 609/86) and local (Italian legislative Decree no. 116, January 27, 1992) regulations for animal care. All animal care procedures were in accordance with the local Animal Care Committee, and no weight loss or death was observed after we had received them in our animal facility.Treatment and sample preparation. Indicated concentrations of somatostatin (dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.3) were added to the cell culture medium on the day after plating. Stimulation was carried out overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Supernatants of stimulated and nonstimulated cells were collected and frozen at \u221220\u00b0C until use, while the monolayers were lysed in a solubilization buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail with broad specificity for the inhibtion of serine, cysteine, aspartic and aminopeptidases (from Sigma-Aldrich).Qualitative Insulin-degrading-enzyme analysis by Western Blotting. Total protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by a Bradford assay [35]. 10 \u00b5g of each sample were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred on Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Membranes were blocked in a PBS Tween (T-PBS) 0.01%, 5% fat-free milk solution, then probed with IDE rabbit polyclonal antibody BC2 (Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA, 1:3000 in T-PBS-0.1% and incubated with an Horse Radish Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA, 1:50000 in T-PBS 0.2% fatty free milk). Immunoreactive signals were detected with an ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis was performed by Image Quant TL program.Secreted IDE quantification in BV-2 cell supernatants by ELISA. IDE goat polyclonal antibody K-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was diluted in PBS 1\u00d7 and coated on a microtiter plate at a final concentration of 0.5 \u00b5g/ml. Unsaturated binding sites were blocked in T-PBS-0.01% 5% fat-free milk solution before exposure to BV-2 cell supernatants. An IDE rabbit polyclonal antibody BC2 (1:3000in T-PBS 0.01%) and a Horse Radish Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:50000 in T-PBS 0.2% fat-free milk) were used for IDE quantification. IDE concentration was determined by using a TMB colorimetric kit according to product instructions. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm in a microtiter plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). A standard curve was performed by using known concentrations of recombinant IDE (Calbiochem).Quantitative real-time PCR. The total RNA from each sample of BV-2 cells was isolated using an RNeasy Plus micro kit for RNA isolation according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA of total RNA was generated in two reaction volumes of Masterscript kit using random hexamers. Real-time PCR was performed by SDS7700 (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) with Manual SYBER ROX Master Mix. GAPDH was measured as the internal control. Primer sequences were: ACGAGGCTATACGTCCAAGATTG and ATTGCCACCCGCACATTTT (Forward and Reverse, respectively) for IDE; AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG and CACATTGGGGGTAGGAACAC (Forward and Reverse, respectively) for GAPDH. The following cycles were performed: initial denaturation cycle at 95\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s, at 58\u00b0C for 30 s and at 68\u00b0C for 30 s.Analysis of MMP-9 in Zymography and Western Blotting. Aliquots of supernatants from cell culture samples were run under non-reducing denaturant conditions on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/mL gelatine (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), soaked twice in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min and then incubated for 18 hrs in the developing buffer (20 mM Tris, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4). For visualization purposes, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained with 10% acetic acid and 20% methanol solution. For the Western blotting analysis of MMP-9 in cell lysates, 10 \u00b5g of whole cell lysate were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a Hybond nitrocellulose membrane. Non-specific sites were blocked with a 0.025% T-PBS 5% fat-free milk solution and filters were then probed with a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, CO 1:2000 in 0.1% T-PBS) and thereafter with a Horse Radish Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, (1:50000 in T-PBS 0.2% fat-free milk). Immunoreactive signals were detected with an ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences).IDE siRNA Transfection. BV-2 cells were used for transfection when 30%\u201340% confluent in order to obtain the greatest transfection efficiency. Cells were transfected with 20 pmol of IDE-siRNA or siRNA control pool using Lipofectamine in OptiMEM media according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Somatostatin stimulation was performed 48 h after transfection.\u00df-amyloid(1\u201340) quantification in BV-2 conditioned medium with sandwich ELISA. Human somatostatin was added at different concentrations to the culture medium of control and IDE-siRNA transfected BV-2 cells. According to the manufacturer's instructions, the incubation was carried out for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and the supernatants collected for \u03b2-amyloid(1\u201340) quantification by ELISA. Equal volumes of each sample were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on plates pre-coated with anti-A\u03b2 (35\u201340) Mouse IgG. HRP conjugated anti-mouse A\u03b2(1\u201316) rabbit IgG was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. Reactivity was developed with TMB for 30 min at room temperature and stopped with 1 N H2SO4. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a microtiter plate reader. A standard curve was obtained with A\u03b2(1\u201340).Statistical analysis. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine significant differences among groups. Tukey's honestly significant difference post hoc test was used for pair wise comparisons after the analysis of variance.Results Top Somatostatin modulation of IDE expressionBV-2 cells as well as primary rat microglia were stimulated with different sst concentrations and the IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of incubation. As shown in Figure 1, sst increases IDE expression in primary (A) and BV-2 cells (B). Since sst half life in the serum is short [36], the same sst concentration was re-added 6 hrs after the first administration. This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression (Figure 1). It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression (data not shown). In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic, rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well (SSTR-1, SSTR-2, and SSTR-4) [37] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations (Figure S1). IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1, no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed.thumbnailFigure 1. Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells.Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples from rat primary microglia (A) and BV-2 (B) indicates that IDE level increases after 24 hrs of somatostatin incubation, while the internal control \u00df-tubulin is constant. The additional incubation with sst after 6 hrs from first round strengthens the effect on IDE expression (left panel). Densitometric analysis of IDE WB signals, average \u00b1 ES of 5 independent experiments in triplicate (right panel). *P<0.05, one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test, n = 15.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g001 Since there was no principle difference in the response to somatostatin in microglia cell lines compared to primary rat microglia, immortalized BV-2 cells were subsequently used. The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a RealTime-PCR. A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs, suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells (Figure 2A).thumbnailFigure 2. Somatostatin modulation on IDE level in BV-2 cells.(A) IDE mRNA increases after 5 hrs of incubation with somatostatin (white columns); 24 hrs after incubation, the level is similar to the control (grey columns). Basal mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR in individual preparations of BV2. Data were first normalized against GAPDH and then expressed setting the value measured in controls at 1. The results presented are the means \u00b1 ES (B) Elisa analysis of conditioned medium indicates that IDE level increases in BV-2 cells after 24 hrs of incubation as a function of somatostatin concentration. The results presented are the means \u00b1 SEs of five independent experiments in triplicate. P<0.05, one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test, n = 15.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretionIt is known that a small fraction of IDE (ranging from 3% to 10%) is secreted into the extracellular space, where it presumably interacts with its substrates, such as insulin and \u03b2-amyloid [8], [38]. In order to determine whether, besides inducing synthesis, sst also stimulates IDE secretion, the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration. As reported in Figure 2B, the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR (Figue 1B and 2A). This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression, but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space.Somatostatin effect on MMP-9 activityIn addition to their ability to phagocyte \u03b2-amyloid, microglia can also clear A\u03b2 by degradation through the production of A\u03b2-degrading enzymes, such as IDE, neprilysin and MMP-9 [29], [33], [39]. Therefore, we assessed whether sst is involved in the regulation of MMP-9 level. For this purpose, BV-2 cells were stimulated with different sst concentrations and MMP-9 activity was measured by zymographyc analysis (Figure 3A). No detectable modulation of MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was observed for each experimental condition. Qualitative analysis of MMP-9 content was further performed on total cell lysates. A polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band around 92 kDa, corresponding to the pro-MMP-9, which is constant over the different sst concentrations (Figure 3B). This result rules out any involvement of sst in the modulation of MMP-9 expression, secretion and activity.thumbnailFigure 3. Effect of somatostatin on MMP-9 expression.(A) Zymographyc analysis of cell culture supernatants harvested after 24 hrs of incubation indicate that somatostain administration does not modulate gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 in each of the experimental conditions. (B) In Western blotting analysis of cell lysates a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 (92 kDa) which is not modulated over each experimental condition. Analysis of \u03b2-tubulin represents the internal control. The results presented are the means \u00b1 ES of three indipendent experiments in triplicate, n = 9.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g003 Octreotide modulation of IDE expressionRecently, somatostatin transmitter replacement has been viewed as a potential AD therapeutical strategy [24], [40]. In this regard, BV-2 cells were stimulated with octreotide, a long-acting octapeptide somatostatin analogue commonly used in clinical trials, in order to verify the effect on the expression pattern of IDE [41]. 0.1\u201310 \u00b5M octreotide induces a dose-dependent increase of IDE expression (Figure 4A) in a similar way to what can be observed in the presence of somatostatin (Figure 1). A similar result can also be obtained for IDE secretion, by using an ELISA assay on BV-2 cell supernatants collected 24 hrs after the administration (Figure 4B). Therefore, these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells (see Figures 1, 2 and 4).thumbnailFigure 4. Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion.(A) WB (left panel) and densitometric analysis of IDE (right panel) after 24 hrs incubation with the indicated concentrations of octreotide. (B) ELISA analysis on BV-2 medium after octreotide incubation reveals that the sst analogue induces IDE secretion. In every case, the results presented are the means \u00b1 ES of four independent experiments in triplicate. * P<0.05, oneway ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test, n = 12.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g004 Somatostatin regulation of A\u03b2(1\u201340) degradation by insulin-degrading-enzymeWe have previously shown that somatostatin is an IDE substrate and an allosteric modulator of recombinant IDE enzymatic activity toward a fluorogenic \u03b2-peptide [17]. Therefore, we aimed to verify whether sst by allosteric modulation of endogenous IDE could affect the clearance of the A\u03b2 peptide secreted by BV-2 cells. To this purpose, IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach. At the maximum rate of IDE silencing (corresponding to about 60%\u201370%, see Figure 5A), different somatostatin concentrations (ranging between 0.01 \u00b5M and 0.5 \u00b5M) were added to the culture medium of both silenced and non-silenced cells. A\u03b2(1\u201340) was quantified in cell supernatants after 1 h of somatostatin stimulation, a time interval during which there was no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE, a fact that was demonstrated through Western Blotting analysis on cell lysates (data not shown). A\u03b2(1\u201340) concentration was slightly reduced at sst 0.01 \u00b5M in both silenced and not-silenced cells. In spite of this, A\u03b2(1\u201340) concentration was not further altered in the medium of silenced cells by increasing sst concentrations, while it was progressively reduced in the medium of non-silenced cells (Figure 5B), suggesting that the reduction of A\u03b2 observed at sst 0.01 in silenced cells could be due to the effect of sst on residual IDE. Therefore, at physiological concentrations, sst modulates IDE activity also by promoting A\u03b2(1\u201340) degradation in the BV-2 cells supernatants.thumbnailFigure 5. Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent A\u03b2 degradation.(A) BV-2 cells transfected with a specific IDE siRNA pool show reduced levels of IDE protein, compared to cells transfected with a nonspecific control siRNA pool (right panel). (B) A\u03b2(1\u201340) quantification through sandwich ELISA reveals that the levels of A\u03b2 are drastically reduced in the presence of IDE steady level (grey columns) compared to IDE-silencing samples (white columns). The results presented are the means \u00b1 ES of three independent experiments in triplicate. P<0.05, one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test, n = 9. *Significantly different from internal control. +Significantly different from silenced sample in the absence of somatostatin. \u00d7Significantly different from not-silenced sample in the absence of somatostatin.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g005 Discussion Top Although several pathological mechanisms of AD progression have been described, ranging from protein aggregation to oxidative stress, mitochondrial failure, metal dyshomeostasis and microglia dysfunction, the important role of amyloid deposition is now widely recognized [7]. In this regard, the extracellular A\u03b2 degrading enzymes (such as IDE, MMP-9 and NEP) are now considered promising therapeutic targets for AD treatment [33]. Notably, IDE is the main extracellular protease secreted by microglia involved in A\u03b2 degradation, even though the molecular basis of IDE regulation are poorly known [5]. Microglia seems to cover a two-fold role in AD pathogenesis. Firstly, early microglia activation exerts a neuroprotective effect by promoting A\u03b2 clearance. Secondly, as the disease progresses, the microglia A\u03b2-clearing capability is compromised [38], [41]. This downregulation is followed by an increase of A\u03b2 released by neurons and by a worsening of the disease [32]. We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [17]. In this work, we further study the effect of sst on IDE showing that the neuropeptide somatostatin also specifically regulates IDE, the main extracellular A\u03b2 protease, by affecting its expression and secretion in both primary and BV-2 microglia cells. Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate: IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation, returning to the basal level within 24 hrs, whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times, being still clearly evident after 24 hrs. Through this pathway, somatostatin enhances IDE secretion, strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with \u03b2-amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates. This effect is specific for IDE since sst does not affect either secretion and activity of MMP-9, another enzyme which is active in A\u03b2 degradation. It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [3], [20]. It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of \u03b2-amyloid in the brain. In addition, since the A\u03b2 chronic accumulation triggers a further reduction in sst level [18], all these events could represent a vicious cycle which ultimately favors A\u03b2 plaque formations. As matter of fact, somatostatinergic transmitter replacement is a potentially viable strategy in the treatment of AD, even though the pharmacological restoration of this deficit has not been unequivocally associated to a recovery of normal cognitive performances [24], [26], [40]. In this framework, we tested the octreotide effect on IDE expression, a somatostatin analogue currently used in the treatment of acromegaly, pituitary adenomes and pancreatic tumors [41], [42]. Here, we show that, like somatostatin, octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion, although the effects are generally reduced compared to the endogenous modulator. Somatostatin binds all five receptor subtypes with high affinity, whereas octreotide is a selective agonist, binding to receptor subtypes 2 and 5 with high affinity (but lower than somatostatin) and with moderate affinity to subtype 3 [41]. Therefore, this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression, even though additional factors cannot be ruled out. Interestingly, we also observed that in astrocytes, incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression, reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells. This discrepancy is probably due to the different expression pattern of sst receptor on microglia (i.e. SSTR-2, SSTR-3, and SSTR-4) and astrocytes (i.e. SSTR-1, SSTR-2, and SSTR-4) [31], [35]. In our previous work, we reported that somatostatin is an allosteric modulator of IDE enzymatic activity on a fluorogenic A\u03b2-peptide [17]. Here, we show that somatostatin addition to the culture medium of BV-2 cells rapidly affects the amyloid \u03b2-peptide (1\u201340) extracellular concentration: after 1 h of stimulation (a time interval over which there is no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE), we observe a negative correlation between A\u03b2 concentration and sst concentration. The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in A\u03b2 levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration. As a whole, the reported data indicate that somatostatin regulates IDE expression, secretion and catalytic activity in microglia. These results are intriguing, considering that a microglia pharmacological manipulation is thought to play a neuroprotective role at least in the early stages of AD, since these cells cluster around senile plaques promoting A\u03b2 phagocytosis and degradation [3], [40], [43]. Therefore, a correlation can be envisaged between the regulation of IDE activity and the microglial immunological function during the development of AD, opening a new therapeutic scenario for the control of AD in the early phases.Supporting Information Top Figure S1.

Insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting A\u03b2, and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy. We show that the active form of somatostatin-14 regulates IDE activity by affecting its expression and secretion in microglia cells. A similar effect can also be observed when adding octreotide. Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE, here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A\u03b2 catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments. As a whole, these data indicate the relevant role played by somatostatin and, potentially, by analogue octreotide, in preventing A\u03b2 accumulation by partially restoring IDE activity.Citation: Tundo G, Ciaccio C, Sbardella D, Boraso M, Viviani B, et al.

Although molecular basis of AD remains largely unclear, there is considerable evidence which supports the so-called \u201camyloid cascade hypothesis\u201d: AD may be viewed as a metabolic vicious cycle in which \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition into senile plaques drives neurodegeneration by triggering abnormal microglia activation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation and the consequent death of astrocytes and neurons. A\u03b2 accumulation in the brain is the result of the imbalance between its biosynthesis and removal [2], [3]. Several proteases, such as insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE), neprilysin (NEP) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are involved in A\u03b2 degradation [4]\u2013[6]. In this regard, a decrease in A\u03b2-degrading enzymes expression or activity, as a result of genetic factors, age and environmental conditions, may be a crucial aspect in AD pathogenesis [7]. Notably, IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates, including insulin, amylin, glucagon, atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [8]. Even though its role in the onset of AD is not yet to be completely understood [5], the relevance of IDE in AD pathogenesis has been validated in works which have mapped the IDE gene on chromosome 10 [9], [10], making it a candidate gene for the AD-6 locus. Furthermore, it has been shown that, during aging, IDE decreases in the brain of AD patients [11]\u2013[13]. Additionally, several studies underline a link between IDE haplotypes and SNPs in the IDE gene, associating them to AD [14]\u2013[16]. We have recently demonstrated that somatostatin (sst) is a substrate and an allosteric modulator of IDE activity, which enhances the proteolytic processing of a synthetic A\u03b2-peptide [17]. Somatostatin depletion in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients is directly connected to memory and learning impairment [18]\u2013[20] and a strong reduction of sst-expressing neurons in the mouse CA1 hippocampal region seems to be associated to the onset of AD [21]. Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [22]. Although molecular mechanisms coupling somatostatin depletion and AD remain unclear, somatostatin transmitter replacement has been identified as a potential pharmacological strategy for AD prevention [23], [24]. Furthermore, the activation of somatostatin neurotransmission by sst-releasing agents, such as FK960 and FK962, has been shown to significantly improve cognitive performances in animal models [25], [26]. On the other hand, although in the past, the use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide in clinical trials has not been unequivocally associated to the restoration of cognitive functions, there is some evidence which seems to demonstrate its potential therapeutic value [24], [27]. Since microglia secretes A\u03b2 and IDE [28], [29] and displays three functionally active receptor subtypes for somatostatin (sst) (i.e. Receptors type 2, 3 and 4) [30], [31], we investigated sst effect on IDE expression in microglia cells. In this work, we show that in activated microglia, somatostatin regulates IDE expression, secretion and proteolytic activity toward A\u03b2, which suggests that somatostatin pathological depletion could be one of the key events leading to A\u03b2 deposition.Materials and Methods Top MaterialsMouse BV-2 microglial cells were kindly provided by Prof. D. Rosato (University of Perugia, Italy) and N9 cells by Prof. R. Ciccarelli (University of Chieti, Italy) [32], [33]. Octreotide was a generous gift from Italfarmaco. RPMI 1640, fetal bovine serum, L-glutammine, penicillin, streptomycin, sodium pyruvate and ciprofloxacin were purchased from Euro Clone (Life Sciences Division, Italy). Minimum essential Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, trypsin 2.5%, DNAse 1%, glucose, streptomycin, penicillin, L-glutammine, L-leucine methyl ester were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human somatostatin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA); recombinant insulin degrading-enzyme was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA); \u03b2-amyloid (1\u201340) was obtained from Anaspec (San Jose, CA, USA). An IDE siRNA SmartPool and a non-specific control pool were synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA). Each pool contains four individual siRNA duplex sequences. Lipofectamine and OptiMEM medium were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). A \u03b2-amyloid(1\u201340) Elisa kit was obtained from IBL-Humburg (Hamburg, Germany); an RNasy Plus micro kit for RNA isolation was obtained from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) and a Masterscript kit and SYBER ROX Master Mix came from 5PRIME (Humburg, Germany). All other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich.Methods Top Cell culture. BV-2, a murine microglial cell line, was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutammine (2 mM), penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 \u00b5g/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mM) and ciprofloxacin (0.03 mM). Cells were seeded on 96-well plates (1\u00d7104/well) and grown overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2[32].Astrocytes and microglia cell cultures. Primary cultures of glial cells were prepared from 2-day-old newborn rats (Sprague\u2013Dawley, Charles River, Calco, Italy). Cerebral hemispheres were freed of the meninges and were mechanically disrupted. Cells were dissociated in a solution of trypsin 2.5% and DNAse 1%, filtered through a 100-\u00b5m nylon mesh, and plated in a 75 cm2 flask (5\u00d7106/flask) in minimum essential Eagle's medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glucose (0.6%), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), penicillin (100 IU/ml) and L-glutammine (2 mM). Glial cultures were fed twice a week and grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. A layer of astrocytic cells was obtained through the vigorous shaking of a confluent 10-day-old monolayer of mixed glial cells [34]. Cultures of enriched astroglia were treated further with 5 mM L-leucine methyl ester to eliminate microglia (97% homogeneity). Isolated astroglial preparations were then seeded in 96-well plates (6\u00d7104/well) in MEM with supplements as above. Microglia were isolated by shaking glial cultures at 260 rpm for 2 hrs. Microglia which dislodged into the medium were purified by plating for 30 min in 96-well plates (6\u00d7104/well). Contaminating cells were removed with supernatant. These conditions allowed us to obtain highly enriched microglial cultures with 98% homogeneity, as assessed by immunocytochemistry with Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4.All animal protocols have been performed to Department of Pharmacological Sciences, University of Milan. The experiments were designed so as to minimize the number of animals used. Animal protocols for these studies have been approved for Department of Pharmacological Sciences by the Ministry of Health and were conducted with minimal suffering of the animals and strictly following European Community (ECC Directive no. 609/86) and local (Italian legislative Decree no. 116, January 27, 1992) regulations for animal care. All animal care procedures were in accordance with the local Animal Care Committee, and no weight loss or death was observed after we had received them in our animal facility.Treatment and sample preparation. Indicated concentrations of somatostatin (dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.3) were added to the cell culture medium on the day after plating. Stimulation was carried out overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Supernatants of stimulated and nonstimulated cells were collected and frozen at \u221220\u00b0C until use, while the monolayers were lysed in a solubilization buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail with broad specificity for the inhibtion of serine, cysteine, aspartic and aminopeptidases (from Sigma-Aldrich).Qualitative Insulin-degrading-enzyme analysis by Western Blotting. Total protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by a Bradford assay [35]. 10 \u00b5g of each sample were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred on Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Membranes were blocked in a PBS Tween (T-PBS) 0.01%, 5% fat-free milk solution, then probed with IDE rabbit polyclonal antibody BC2 (Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA, 1:3000 in T-PBS-0.1% and incubated with an Horse Radish Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA, 1:50000 in T-PBS 0.2% fatty free milk). Immunoreactive signals were detected with an ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis was performed by Image Quant TL program.Secreted IDE quantification in BV-2 cell supernatants by ELISA. IDE goat polyclonal antibody K-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was diluted in PBS 1\u00d7 and coated on a microtiter plate at a final concentration of 0.5 \u00b5g/ml. Unsaturated binding sites were blocked in T-PBS-0.01% 5% fat-free milk solution before exposure to BV-2 cell supernatants. An IDE rabbit polyclonal antibody BC2 (1:3000in T-PBS 0.01%) and a Horse Radish Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:50000 in T-PBS 0.2% fat-free milk) were used for IDE quantification. IDE concentration was determined by using a TMB colorimetric kit according to product instructions. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm in a microtiter plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). A standard curve was performed by using known concentrations of recombinant IDE (Calbiochem).Quantitative real-time PCR. The total RNA from each sample of BV-2 cells was isolated using an RNeasy Plus micro kit for RNA isolation according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA of total RNA was generated in two reaction volumes of Masterscript kit using random hexamers. Real-time PCR was performed by SDS7700 (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) with Manual SYBER ROX Master Mix. GAPDH was measured as the internal control. Primer sequences were: ACGAGGCTATACGTCCAAGATTG and ATTGCCACCCGCACATTTT (Forward and Reverse, respectively) for IDE; AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG and CACATTGGGGGTAGGAACAC (Forward and Reverse, respectively) for GAPDH. The following cycles were performed: initial denaturation cycle at 95\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s, at 58\u00b0C for 30 s and at 68\u00b0C for 30 s.Analysis of MMP-9 in Zymography and Western Blotting. Aliquots of supernatants from cell culture samples were run under non-reducing denaturant conditions on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/mL gelatine (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), soaked twice in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min and then incubated for 18 hrs in the developing buffer (20 mM Tris, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4). For visualization purposes, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained with 10% acetic acid and 20% methanol solution. For the Western blotting analysis of MMP-9 in cell lysates, 10 \u00b5g of whole cell lysate were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a Hybond nitrocellulose membrane. Non-specific sites were blocked with a 0.025% T-PBS 5% fat-free milk solution and filters were then probed with a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, CO 1:2000 in 0.1% T-PBS) and thereafter with a Horse Radish Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, (1:50000 in T-PBS 0.2% fat-free milk). Immunoreactive signals were detected with an ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences).IDE siRNA Transfection. BV-2 cells were used for transfection when 30%\u201340% confluent in order to obtain the greatest transfection efficiency. Cells were transfected with 20 pmol of IDE-siRNA or siRNA control pool using Lipofectamine in OptiMEM media according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Somatostatin stimulation was performed 48 h after transfection.\u00df-amyloid(1\u201340) quantification in BV-2 conditioned medium with sandwich ELISA. Human somatostatin was added at different concentrations to the culture medium of control and IDE-siRNA transfected BV-2 cells. According to the manufacturer's instructions, the incubation was carried out for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and the supernatants collected for \u03b2-amyloid(1\u201340) quantification by ELISA. Equal volumes of each sample were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on plates pre-coated with anti-A\u03b2 (35\u201340) Mouse IgG. HRP conjugated anti-mouse A\u03b2(1\u201316) rabbit IgG was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. Reactivity was developed with TMB for 30 min at room temperature and stopped with 1 N H2SO4. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a microtiter plate reader. A standard curve was obtained with A\u03b2(1\u201340).Statistical analysis. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine significant differences among groups. Tukey's honestly significant difference post hoc test was used for pair wise comparisons after the analysis of variance.Results Top Somatostatin modulation of IDE expressionBV-2 cells as well as primary rat microglia were stimulated with different sst concentrations and the IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of incubation. As shown in Figure 1, sst increases IDE expression in primary (A) and BV-2 cells (B). Since sst half life in the serum is short [36], the same sst concentration was re-added 6 hrs after the first administration. This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression (Figure 1). It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression (data not shown). In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic, rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well (SSTR-1, SSTR-2, and SSTR-4) [37] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations (Figure S1). IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1, no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed.thumbnailFigure 1. Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells.Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples from rat primary microglia (A) and BV-2 (B) indicates that IDE level increases after 24 hrs of somatostatin incubation, while the internal control \u00df-tubulin is constant. The additional incubation with sst after 6 hrs from first round strengthens the effect on IDE expression (left panel). Densitometric analysis of IDE WB signals, average \u00b1 ES of 5 independent experiments in triplicate (right panel). *P<0.05, one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test, n = 15.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g001 Since there was no principle difference in the response to somatostatin in microglia cell lines compared to primary rat microglia, immortalized BV-2 cells were subsequently used. The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a RealTime-PCR. A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs, suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells (Figure 2A).thumbnailFigure 2. Somatostatin modulation on IDE level in BV-2 cells.(A) IDE mRNA increases after 5 hrs of incubation with somatostatin (white columns); 24 hrs after incubation, the level is similar to the control (grey columns). Basal mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR in individual preparations of BV2. Data were first normalized against GAPDH and then expressed setting the value measured in controls at 1. The results presented are the means \u00b1 ES (B) Elisa analysis of conditioned medium indicates that IDE level increases in BV-2 cells after 24 hrs of incubation as a function of somatostatin concentration. The results presented are the means \u00b1 SEs of five independent experiments in triplicate. P<0.05, one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test, n = 15.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretionIt is known that a small fraction of IDE (ranging from 3% to 10%) is secreted into the extracellular space, where it presumably interacts with its substrates, such as insulin and \u03b2-amyloid [8], [38]. In order to determine whether, besides inducing synthesis, sst also stimulates IDE secretion, the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration. As reported in Figure 2B, the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR (Figue 1B and 2A). This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression, but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space.Somatostatin effect on MMP-9 activityIn addition to their ability to phagocyte \u03b2-amyloid, microglia can also clear A\u03b2 by degradation through the production of A\u03b2-degrading enzymes, such as IDE, neprilysin and MMP-9 [29], [33], [39]. Therefore, we assessed whether sst is involved in the regulation of MMP-9 level. For this purpose, BV-2 cells were stimulated with different sst concentrations and MMP-9 activity was measured by zymographyc analysis (Figure 3A). No detectable modulation of MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was observed for each experimental condition. Qualitative analysis of MMP-9 content was further performed on total cell lysates. A polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band around 92 kDa, corresponding to the pro-MMP-9, which is constant over the different sst concentrations (Figure 3B). This result rules out any involvement of sst in the modulation of MMP-9 expression, secretion and activity.thumbnailFigure 3. Effect of somatostatin on MMP-9 expression.(A) Zymographyc analysis of cell culture supernatants harvested after 24 hrs of incubation indicate that somatostain administration does not modulate gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 in each of the experimental conditions. (B) In Western blotting analysis of cell lysates a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 (92 kDa) which is not modulated over each experimental condition.

In this regard, BV-2 cells were stimulated with octreotide, a long-acting octapeptide somatostatin analogue commonly used in clinical trials, in order to verify the effect on the expression pattern of IDE [41]. 0.1\u201310 \u00b5M octreotide induces a dose-dependent increase of IDE expression (Figure 4A) in a similar way to what can be observed in the presence of somatostatin (Figure 1). A similar result can also be obtained for IDE secretion, by using an ELISA assay on BV-2 cell supernatants collected 24 hrs after the administration (Figure 4B). Therefore, these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells (see Figures 1, 2 and 4).thumbnailFigure 4. Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion.(A) WB (left panel) and densitometric analysis of IDE (right panel) after 24 hrs incubation with the indicated concentrations of octreotide. (B) ELISA analysis on BV-2 medium after octreotide incubation reveals that the sst analogue induces IDE secretion.

Therefore, we aimed to verify whether sst by allosteric modulation of endogenous IDE could affect the clearance of the A\u03b2 peptide secreted by BV-2 cells. To this purpose, IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach. At the maximum rate of IDE silencing (corresponding to about 60%\u201370%, see Figure 5A), different somatostatin concentrations (ranging between 0.01 \u00b5M and 0.5 \u00b5M) were added to the culture medium of both silenced and non-silenced cells. A\u03b2(1\u201340) was quantified in cell supernatants after 1 h of somatostatin stimulation, a time interval during which there was no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE, a fact that was demonstrated through Western Blotting analysis on cell lysates (data not shown). A\u03b2(1\u201340) concentration was slightly reduced at sst 0.01 \u00b5M in both silenced and not-silenced cells. In spite of this, A\u03b2(1\u201340) concentration was not further altered in the medium of silenced cells by increasing sst concentrations, while it was progressively reduced in the medium of non-silenced cells (Figure 5B), suggesting that the reduction of A\u03b2 observed at sst 0.01 in silenced cells could be due to the effect of sst on residual IDE. Therefore, at physiological concentrations, sst modulates IDE activity also by promoting A\u03b2(1\u201340) degradation in the BV-2 cells supernatants.thumbnailFigure 5.

(B) A\u03b2(1\u201340) quantification through sandwich ELISA reveals that the levels of A\u03b2 are drastically reduced in the presence of IDE steady level (grey columns) compared to IDE-silencing samples (white columns).

In this regard, the extracellular A\u03b2 degrading enzymes (such as IDE, MMP-9 and NEP) are now considered promising therapeutic targets for AD treatment [33]. Notably, IDE is the main extracellular protease secreted by microglia involved in A\u03b2 degradation, even though the molecular basis of IDE regulation are poorly known [5]. Microglia seems to cover a two-fold role in AD pathogenesis. Firstly, early microglia activation exerts a neuroprotective effect by promoting A\u03b2 clearance. Secondly, as the disease progresses, the microglia A\u03b2-clearing capability is compromised [38], [41]. This downregulation is followed by an increase of A\u03b2 released by neurons and by a worsening of the disease [32]. We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [17]. In this work, we further study the effect of sst on IDE showing that the neuropeptide somatostatin also specifically regulates IDE, the main extracellular A\u03b2 protease, by affecting its expression and secretion in both primary and BV-2 microglia cells. Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate: IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation, returning to the basal level within 24 hrs, whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times, being still clearly evident after 24 hrs. Through this pathway, somatostatin enhances IDE secretion, strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with \u03b2-amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates. This effect is specific for IDE since sst does not affect either secretion and activity of MMP-9, another enzyme which is active in A\u03b2 degradation. It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [3], [20]. It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of \u03b2-amyloid in the brain. In addition, since the A\u03b2 chronic accumulation triggers a further reduction in sst level [18], all these events could represent a vicious cycle which ultimately favors A\u03b2 plaque formations. As matter of fact, somatostatinergic transmitter replacement is a potentially viable strategy in the treatment of AD, even though the pharmacological restoration of this deficit has not been unequivocally associated to a recovery of normal cognitive performances [24], [26], [40]. In this framework, we tested the octreotide effect on IDE expression, a somatostatin analogue currently used in the treatment of acromegaly, pituitary adenomes and pancreatic tumors [41], [42]. Here, we show that, like somatostatin, octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion, although the effects are generally reduced compared to the endogenous modulator. Somatostatin binds all five receptor subtypes with high affinity, whereas octreotide is a selective agonist, binding to receptor subtypes 2 and 5 with high affinity (but lower than somatostatin) and with moderate affinity to subtype 3 [41]. Therefore, this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression, even though additional factors cannot be ruled out. Interestingly, we also observed that in astrocytes, incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression, reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells. This discrepancy is probably due to the different expression pattern of sst receptor on microglia (i.e. SSTR-2, SSTR-3, and SSTR-4) and astrocytes (i.e. SSTR-1, SSTR-2, and SSTR-4) [31], [35]. In our previous work, we reported that somatostatin is an allosteric modulator of IDE enzymatic activity on a fluorogenic A\u03b2-peptide [17]. Here, we show that somatostatin addition to the culture medium of BV-2 cells rapidly affects the amyloid \u03b2-peptide (1\u201340) extracellular concentration: after 1 h of stimulation (a time interval over which there is no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE), we observe a negative correlation between A\u03b2 concentration and sst concentration. The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in A\u03b2 levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration. As a whole, the reported data indicate that somatostatin regulates IDE expression, secretion and catalytic activity in microglia. These results are intriguing, considering that a microglia pharmacological manipulation is thought to play a neuroprotective role at least in the early stages of AD, since these cells cluster around senile plaques promoting A\u03b2 phagocytosis and degradation [3], [40], [43]. Therefore, a correlation can be envisaged between the regulation of IDE activity and the microglial immunological function during the development of AD, opening a new therapeutic scenario for the control of AD in the early phases.Supporting Information Top Figure S1.

Insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting A\u03b2, and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy. We show that the active form of somatostatin-14 regulates IDE activity by affecting its expression and secretion in microglia cells. A similar effect can also be observed when adding octreotide. Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE, here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A\u03b2 catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments. As a whole, these data indicate the relevant role played by somatostatin and, potentially, by analogue octreotide, in preventing A\u03b2 accumulation by partially restoring IDE activity.Citation: Tundo G, Ciaccio C, Sbardella D, Boraso M, Viviani B, et al.

Although molecular basis of AD remains largely unclear, there is considerable evidence which supports the so-called \u201camyloid cascade hypothesis\u201d: AD may be viewed as a metabolic vicious cycle in which \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition into senile plaques drives neurodegeneration by triggering abnormal microglia activation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation and the consequent death of astrocytes and neurons. A\u03b2 accumulation in the brain is the result of the imbalance between its biosynthesis and removal [2], [3]. Several proteases, such as insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE), neprilysin (NEP) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are involved in A\u03b2 degradation [4]\u2013[6]. In this regard, a decrease in A\u03b2-degrading enzymes expression or activity, as a result of genetic factors, age and environmental conditions, may be a crucial aspect in AD pathogenesis [7]. Notably, IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates, including insulin, amylin, glucagon, atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [8]. Even though its role in the onset of AD is not yet to be completely understood [5], the relevance of IDE in AD pathogenesis has been validated in works which have mapped the IDE gene on chromosome 10 [9], [10], making it a candidate gene for the AD-6 locus. Furthermore, it has been shown that, during aging, IDE decreases in the brain of AD patients [11]\u2013[13]. Additionally, several studies underline a link between IDE haplotypes and SNPs in the IDE gene, associating them to AD [14]\u2013[16]. We have recently demonstrated that somatostatin (sst) is a substrate and an allosteric modulator of IDE activity, which enhances the proteolytic processing of a synthetic A\u03b2-peptide [17]. Somatostatin depletion in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients is directly connected to memory and learning impairment [18]\u2013[20] and a strong reduction of sst-expressing neurons in the mouse CA1 hippocampal region seems to be associated to the onset of AD [21]. Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [22]. Although molecular mechanisms coupling somatostatin depletion and AD remain unclear, somatostatin transmitter replacement has been identified as a potential pharmacological strategy for AD prevention [23], [24]. Furthermore, the activation of somatostatin neurotransmission by sst-releasing agents, such as FK960 and FK962, has been shown to significantly improve cognitive performances in animal models [25], [26]. On the other hand, although in the past, the use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide in clinical trials has not been unequivocally associated to the restoration of cognitive functions, there is some evidence which seems to demonstrate its potential therapeutic value [24], [27]. Since microglia secretes A\u03b2 and IDE [28], [29] and displays three functionally active receptor subtypes for somatostatin (sst) (i.e. Receptors type 2, 3 and 4) [30], [31], we investigated sst effect on IDE expression in microglia cells. In this work, we show that in activated microglia, somatostatin regulates IDE expression, secretion and proteolytic activity toward A\u03b2, which suggests that somatostatin pathological depletion could be one of the key events leading to A\u03b2 deposition.Materials and Methods Top MaterialsMouse BV-2 microglial cells were kindly provided by Prof. D.

A layer of astrocytic cells was obtained through the vigorous shaking of a confluent 10-day-old monolayer of mixed glial cells [34]. Cultures of enriched astroglia were treated further with 5 mM L-leucine methyl ester to eliminate microglia (97% homogeneity). Isolated astroglial preparations were then seeded in 96-well plates (6\u00d7104/well) in MEM with supplements as above. Microglia were isolated by shaking glial cultures at 260 rpm for 2 hrs. Microglia which dislodged into the medium were purified by plating for 30 min in 96-well plates (6\u00d7104/well). Contaminating cells were removed with supernatant. These conditions allowed us to obtain highly enriched microglial cultures with 98% homogeneity, as assessed by immunocytochemistry with Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4.All animal protocols have been performed to Department of Pharmacological Sciences, University of Milan. The experiments were designed so as to minimize the number of animals used. Animal protocols for these studies have been approved for Department of Pharmacological Sciences by the Ministry of Health and were conducted with minimal suffering of the animals and strictly following European Community (ECC Directive no. 609/86) and local (Italian legislative Decree no. 116, January 27, 1992) regulations for animal care. All animal care procedures were in accordance with the local Animal Care Committee, and no weight loss or death was observed after we had received them in our animal facility.Treatment and sample preparation. Indicated concentrations of somatostatin (dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.3) were added to the cell culture medium on the day after plating. Stimulation was carried out overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Supernatants of stimulated and nonstimulated cells were collected and frozen at \u221220\u00b0C until use, while the monolayers were lysed in a solubilization buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail with broad specificity for the inhibtion of serine, cysteine, aspartic and aminopeptidases (from Sigma-Aldrich).Qualitative Insulin-degrading-enzyme analysis by Western Blotting. Total protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by a Bradford assay [35]. 10 \u00b5g of each sample were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred on Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Membranes were blocked in a PBS Tween (T-PBS) 0.01%, 5% fat-free milk solution, then probed with IDE rabbit polyclonal antibody BC2 (Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA, 1:3000 in T-PBS-0.1% and incubated with an Horse Radish Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA, 1:50000 in T-PBS 0.2% fatty free milk). Immunoreactive signals were detected with an ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis was performed by Image Quant TL program.Secreted IDE quantification in BV-2 cell supernatants by ELISA. IDE goat polyclonal antibody K-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was diluted in PBS 1\u00d7 and coated on a microtiter plate at a final concentration of 0.5 \u00b5g/ml. Unsaturated binding sites were blocked in T-PBS-0.01% 5% fat-free milk solution before exposure to BV-2 cell supernatants. An IDE rabbit polyclonal antibody BC2 (1:3000in T-PBS 0.01%) and a Horse Radish Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:50000 in T-PBS 0.2% fat-free milk) were used for IDE quantification. IDE concentration was determined by using a TMB colorimetric kit according to product instructions. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm in a microtiter plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). A standard curve was performed by using known concentrations of recombinant IDE (Calbiochem).Quantitative real-time PCR. The total RNA from each sample of BV-2 cells was isolated using an RNeasy Plus micro kit for RNA isolation according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA of total RNA was generated in two reaction volumes of Masterscript kit using random hexamers. Real-time PCR was performed by SDS7700 (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) with Manual SYBER ROX Master Mix. GAPDH was measured as the internal control. Primer sequences were: ACGAGGCTATACGTCCAAGATTG and ATTGCCACCCGCACATTTT (Forward and Reverse, respectively) for IDE; AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG and CACATTGGGGGTAGGAACAC (Forward and Reverse, respectively) for GAPDH. The following cycles were performed: initial denaturation cycle at 95\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s, at 58\u00b0C for 30 s and at 68\u00b0C for 30 s.Analysis of MMP-9 in Zymography and Western Blotting. Aliquots of supernatants from cell culture samples were run under non-reducing denaturant conditions on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/mL gelatine (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), soaked twice in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min and then incubated for 18 hrs in the developing buffer (20 mM Tris, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4). For visualization purposes, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained with 10% acetic acid and 20% methanol solution. For the Western blotting analysis of MMP-9 in cell lysates, 10 \u00b5g of whole cell lysate were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a Hybond nitrocellulose membrane. Non-specific sites were blocked with a 0.025% T-PBS 5% fat-free milk solution and filters were then probed with a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, CO 1:2000 in 0.1% T-PBS) and thereafter with a Horse Radish Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, (1:50000 in T-PBS 0.2% fat-free milk). Immunoreactive signals were detected with an ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences).IDE siRNA Transfection. BV-2 cells were used for transfection when 30%\u201340% confluent in order to obtain the greatest transfection efficiency. Cells were transfected with 20 pmol of IDE-siRNA or siRNA control pool using Lipofectamine in OptiMEM media according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Somatostatin stimulation was performed 48 h after transfection.\u00df-amyloid(1\u201340) quantification in BV-2 conditioned medium with sandwich ELISA. Human somatostatin was added at different concentrations to the culture medium of control and IDE-siRNA transfected BV-2 cells. According to the manufacturer's instructions, the incubation was carried out for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and the supernatants collected for \u03b2-amyloid(1\u201340) quantification by ELISA. Equal volumes of each sample were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on plates pre-coated with anti-A\u03b2 (35\u201340) Mouse IgG. HRP conjugated anti-mouse A\u03b2(1\u201316) rabbit IgG was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. Reactivity was developed with TMB for 30 min at room temperature and stopped with 1 N H2SO4. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a microtiter plate reader. A standard curve was obtained with A\u03b2(1\u201340).Statistical analysis. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine significant differences among groups. Tukey's honestly significant difference post hoc test was used for pair wise comparisons after the analysis of variance.Results Top Somatostatin modulation of IDE expressionBV-2 cells as well as primary rat microglia were stimulated with different sst concentrations and the IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of incubation. As shown in Figure 1, sst increases IDE expression in primary (A) and BV-2 cells (B). Since sst half life in the serum is short [36], the same sst concentration was re-added 6 hrs after the first administration. This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression (Figure 1). It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression (data not shown). In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic, rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well (SSTR-1, SSTR-2, and SSTR-4) [37] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations (Figure S1). IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1, no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed.thumbnailFigure 1. Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells.Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples from rat primary microglia (A) and BV-2 (B) indicates that IDE level increases after 24 hrs of somatostatin incubation, while the internal control \u00df-tubulin is constant. The additional incubation with sst after 6 hrs from first round strengthens the effect on IDE expression (left panel). Densitometric analysis of IDE WB signals, average \u00b1 ES of 5 independent experiments in triplicate (right panel). *P<0.05, one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test, n = 15.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g001 Since there was no principle difference in the response to somatostatin in microglia cell lines compared to primary rat microglia, immortalized BV-2 cells were subsequently used. The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a RealTime-PCR. A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs, suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells (Figure 2A).thumbnailFigure 2. Somatostatin modulation on IDE level in BV-2 cells.(A) IDE mRNA increases after 5 hrs of incubation with somatostatin (white columns); 24 hrs after incubation, the level is similar to the control (grey columns). Basal mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR in individual preparations of BV2. Data were first normalized against GAPDH and then expressed setting the value measured in controls at 1. The results presented are the means \u00b1 ES (B) Elisa analysis of conditioned medium indicates that IDE level increases in BV-2 cells after 24 hrs of incubation as a function of somatostatin concentration. The results presented are the means \u00b1 SEs of five independent experiments in triplicate. P<0.05, one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test, n = 15.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretionIt is known that a small fraction of IDE (ranging from 3% to 10%) is secreted into the extracellular space, where it presumably interacts with its substrates, such as insulin and \u03b2-amyloid [8], [38]. In order to determine whether, besides inducing synthesis, sst also stimulates IDE secretion, the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration. As reported in Figure 2B, the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR (Figue 1B and 2A). This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression, but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space.Somatostatin effect on MMP-9 activityIn addition to their ability to phagocyte \u03b2-amyloid, microglia can also clear A\u03b2 by degradation through the production of A\u03b2-degrading enzymes, such as IDE, neprilysin and MMP-9 [29], [33], [39]. Therefore, we assessed whether sst is involved in the regulation of MMP-9 level. For this purpose, BV-2 cells were stimulated with different sst concentrations and MMP-9 activity was measured by zymographyc analysis (Figure 3A). No detectable modulation of MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was observed for each experimental condition. Qualitative analysis of MMP-9 content was further performed on total cell lysates. A polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band around 92 kDa, corresponding to the pro-MMP-9, which is constant over the different sst concentrations (Figure 3B). This result rules out any involvement of sst in the modulation of MMP-9 expression, secretion and activity.thumbnailFigure 3. Effect of somatostatin on MMP-9 expression.(A) Zymographyc analysis of cell culture supernatants harvested after 24 hrs of incubation indicate that somatostain administration does not modulate gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 in each of the experimental conditions. (B) In Western blotting analysis of cell lysates a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 (92 kDa) which is not modulated over each experimental condition. Analysis of \u03b2-tubulin represents the internal control. The results presented are the means \u00b1 ES of three indipendent experiments in triplicate, n = 9.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g003 Octreotide modulation of IDE expressionRecently, somatostatin transmitter replacement has been viewed as a potential AD therapeutical strategy [24], [40]. In this regard, BV-2 cells were stimulated with octreotide, a long-acting octapeptide somatostatin analogue commonly used in clinical trials, in order to verify the effect on the expression pattern of IDE [41]. 0.1\u201310 \u00b5M octreotide induces a dose-dependent increase of IDE expression (Figure 4A) in a similar way to what can be observed in the presence of somatostatin (Figure 1). A similar result can also be obtained for IDE secretion, by using an ELISA assay on BV-2 cell supernatants collected 24 hrs after the administration (Figure 4B). Therefore, these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells (see Figures 1, 2 and 4).thumbnailFigure 4. Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion.(A) WB (left panel) and densitometric analysis of IDE (right panel) after 24 hrs incubation with the indicated concentrations of octreotide. (B) ELISA analysis on BV-2 medium after octreotide incubation reveals that the sst analogue induces IDE secretion. In every case, the results presented are the means \u00b1 ES of four independent experiments in triplicate. * P<0.05, oneway ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test, n = 12.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g004 Somatostatin regulation of A\u03b2(1\u201340) degradation by insulin-degrading-enzymeWe have previously shown that somatostatin is an IDE substrate and an allosteric modulator of recombinant IDE enzymatic activity toward a fluorogenic \u03b2-peptide [17]. Therefore, we aimed to verify whether sst by allosteric modulation of endogenous IDE could affect the clearance of the A\u03b2 peptide secreted by BV-2 cells. To this purpose, IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach. At the maximum rate of IDE silencing (corresponding to about 60%\u201370%, see Figure 5A), different somatostatin concentrations (ranging between 0.01 \u00b5M and 0.5 \u00b5M) were added to the culture medium of both silenced and non-silenced cells. A\u03b2(1\u201340) was quantified in cell supernatants after 1 h of somatostatin stimulation, a time interval during which there was no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE, a fact that was demonstrated through Western Blotting analysis on cell lysates (data not shown). A\u03b2(1\u201340) concentration was slightly reduced at sst 0.01 \u00b5M in both silenced and not-silenced cells. In spite of this, A\u03b2(1\u201340) concentration was not further altered in the medium of silenced cells by increasing sst concentrations, while it was progressively reduced in the medium of non-silenced cells (Figure 5B), suggesting that the reduction of A\u03b2 observed at sst 0.01 in silenced cells could be due to the effect of sst on residual IDE. Therefore, at physiological concentrations, sst modulates IDE activity also by promoting A\u03b2(1\u201340) degradation in the BV-2 cells supernatants.thumbnailFigure 5. Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent A\u03b2 degradation.(A) BV-2 cells transfected with a specific IDE siRNA pool show reduced levels of IDE protein, compared to cells transfected with a nonspecific control siRNA pool (right panel). (B) A\u03b2(1\u201340) quantification through sandwich ELISA reveals that the levels of A\u03b2 are drastically reduced in the presence of IDE steady level (grey columns) compared to IDE-silencing samples (white columns).

In this regard, the extracellular A\u03b2 degrading enzymes (such as IDE, MMP-9 and NEP) are now considered promising therapeutic targets for AD treatment [33]. Notably, IDE is the main extracellular protease secreted by microglia involved in A\u03b2 degradation, even though the molecular basis of IDE regulation are poorly known [5]. Microglia seems to cover a two-fold role in AD pathogenesis. Firstly, early microglia activation exerts a neuroprotective effect by promoting A\u03b2 clearance. Secondly, as the disease progresses, the microglia A\u03b2-clearing capability is compromised [38], [41]. This downregulation is followed by an increase of A\u03b2 released by neurons and by a worsening of the disease [32]. We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [17]. In this work, we further study the effect of sst on IDE showing that the neuropeptide somatostatin also specifically regulates IDE, the main extracellular A\u03b2 protease, by affecting its expression and secretion in both primary and BV-2 microglia cells. Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate: IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation, returning to the basal level within 24 hrs, whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times, being still clearly evident after 24 hrs. Through this pathway, somatostatin enhances IDE secretion, strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with \u03b2-amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates. This effect is specific for IDE since sst does not affect either secretion and activity of MMP-9, another enzyme which is active in A\u03b2 degradation. It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [3], [20]. It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of \u03b2-amyloid in the brain. In addition, since the A\u03b2 chronic accumulation triggers a further reduction in sst level [18], all these events could represent a vicious cycle which ultimately favors A\u03b2 plaque formations. As matter of fact, somatostatinergic transmitter replacement is a potentially viable strategy in the treatment of AD, even though the pharmacological restoration of this deficit has not been unequivocally associated to a recovery of normal cognitive performances [24], [26], [40]. In this framework, we tested the octreotide effect on IDE expression, a somatostatin analogue currently used in the treatment of acromegaly, pituitary adenomes and pancreatic tumors [41], [42]. Here, we show that, like somatostatin, octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion, although the effects are generally reduced compared to the endogenous modulator. Somatostatin binds all five receptor subtypes with high affinity, whereas octreotide is a selective agonist, binding to receptor subtypes 2 and 5 with high affinity (but lower than somatostatin) and with moderate affinity to subtype 3 [41]. Therefore, this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression, even though additional factors cannot be ruled out. Interestingly, we also observed that in astrocytes, incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression, reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells. This discrepancy is probably due to the different expression pattern of sst receptor on microglia (i.e. SSTR-2, SSTR-3, and SSTR-4) and astrocytes (i.e. SSTR-1, SSTR-2, and SSTR-4) [31], [35]. In our previous work, we reported that somatostatin is an allosteric modulator of IDE enzymatic activity on a fluorogenic A\u03b2-peptide [17]. Here, we show that somatostatin addition to the culture medium of BV-2 cells rapidly affects the amyloid \u03b2-peptide (1\u201340) extracellular concentration: after 1 h of stimulation (a time interval over which there is no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE), we observe a negative correlation between A\u03b2 concentration and sst concentration. The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in A\u03b2 levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration. As a whole, the reported data indicate that somatostatin regulates IDE expression, secretion and catalytic activity in microglia. These results are intriguing, considering that a microglia pharmacological manipulation is thought to play a neuroprotective role at least in the early stages of AD, since these cells cluster around senile plaques promoting A\u03b2 phagocytosis and degradation [3], [40], [43]. Therefore, a correlation can be envisaged between the regulation of IDE activity and the microglial immunological function during the development of AD, opening a new therapeutic scenario for the control of AD in the early phases.Supporting Information Top Figure S1.

Particularly, mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein (APP) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity. Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally. In this paper, we will outline current knowledge of the intracellular localization of amyloid-beta. Moreover, we summarize evidence from AD postmortem brain as well as animal AD models showing that amyloid-beta triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through a number of pathways such as impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, elevation of reactive oxygen species production, alteration of mitochondrial dynamics, and interaction with mitochondrial proteins. Thus, this paper supports the Alzheimer cascade mitochondrial hypothesis such as the most important early events in this disease, and probably one of the future strategies on the therapy of this neurodegenerative disease. 1. IntroductionEach year, over 10 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases. This figure is expected to grow by 20% over the next decade as the aging population increases and lives longer. This disease group is the fourth biggest killer in the developed world after heart diseases, cancer, and stroke [1]. The most common neurodegenerative diseases are AD, Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [2]. The most widely recognized is AD, which is among the principal debilitating conditions of the current century. Approximately 24 million people worldwide suffer from dementia, 60% of cases being due to AD, which occurs in 1% of individuals aged 50 to 70 years old and dramatically increases to 50% of those over 70 years old [3]. Dramatically, these numbers are estimated to increase to 15 million in the next 40 years [4].From the neuropathological point of view, AD is characterized by selective neuronal loss, marked synaptic alteration, morphological mitochondrial abnormalities, and Tau pathology. The histological hallmark lesions of AD are characterized by senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits. The extracellular amyloid plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles built up of hyperphosphorylated tau, although the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still unknown and there is still no cure. Many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes and plays an important role in the pathological process in AD, and more recently, energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent, early event in AD [1\u201311]. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging, the best established risk factor for AD. Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [12, 13]. Recently, we described that PLA2G3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of the free radical-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase- (X-XOD-) system-induced cell death, and that PLA2G3 polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Spanish case-control sample [14]. In previous studies with choroid plexus homogenates with different cases with AD in the different stages (I/0, III-IV, and V-VI), we demonstrated that in AD patients, amyloid-beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus [15], there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), and N-carboxyethyl-lysine (CEL) may result in impaired protein interactions, protein folding, and protein kinase activity; abnormal function of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [16].2. MitochondriaMitochondria are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells and function to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by oxidative phosphorylation and are thought to be derived evolutionarily from the fusion of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [17]. They are also involved in regulation of cell death via apoptosis, in the control of cell division and growth, in calcium homeostasis, haem biosynthesis, and in the formation and export of iron-sulphur clusters.Mitochondria are composed of a double lipid membrane which structures four compartments, distinct by composition and function (Figure 1). The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle. It contains many proteins like import complexes and voltage-dependent anion channels responsible for the free passage of low-molecular-weight substances (up to 5000 Da) between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space which represents a reservoir of protons establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane that is needed for the production of ATP via ATPase (complex V). Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, EndoG, and Htra2/Omi. In contrast to the permeable outer membrane, the inner mitochondrial membrane, rich in cardiolipin, provides a highly efficient barrier to the flow of small molecules and ions, including protons. This membrane is invaginated into numerous cristae increasing cell surface area. It houses the respiratory enzymes of the electron transport chain, the cofactor coenzyme Q, and many mitochondrial carriers. In the matrix, different metabolic pathways take place including the tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle [18].324968.fig.001Figure 1: Representative electromicrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure. Scale bar 200 nm.Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles in that they have their own, circular, double-stranded DNA (mtDNA) which is inherited almost exclusively down the maternal line and codes for 37 mitochondrial genes, 13 of which translate to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation [18, 19]. The remaining genes encode transfer (22 genes) and ribosomal (2 genes) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins. Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins, the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria, including those involved in DNA transcription, translation, and repair, are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol. As mtDNA is located in the mitochondria in close proximity to the electron transport chain, it is more susceptible to damage from free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation [20].Mitochondria generate energy by two closely coordinated metabolic processes: Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). OXPHOS is made up of the electron transport chain assembled in four enzymes (complex I to IV) as well as the F1F0-ATP synthase (complex V). Complexes I, III, and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins, whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane. The function of the chain is to generate cellular energy in the form of ATP. These five enzymes of the complex are connected functionally by mobile electron acceptors and donors: ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are fed into complexes I and II, respectively. Ubiquinone Q carries electrons from both complexes to complex II, and cytochrome c does it from complex III to IV reducing molecular oxygen to water. As electrons are transferred along electron transport chain, a fixed number of protons are pumped from the matrix into inner membrane space establishing a electrochemical gradient characterized with a specific electrical potential. The redox energy drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP as protons are transported back from inner membrane space into the matrix via complex V.3. Amyloid-Beta in the CytosolAccumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss, being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis. Moreover, previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain, the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells. Many studies showed amyloid-beta interaction with different receptors in the cellular membrane of the vasculature, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and glial cells where it is transported from cell surface into endosomal and lysosomal compartments [21\u201323]. The aberrant signalling of these receptors in AD triggered an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta into cytosol-inducing cellular stress underlies to neuronal dysfunction and dementia.It is described by our group and others that these receptors can be megalin, also known as low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 (LRP2) [24], LRP-1 [22], or RAGE (receptors for advanced glycation end products) [25]. The interaction of these receptors with amyloid-beta in neurons, microglia, and vascular cells accelerates and amplifies deleterious effects on neuronal and synaptic functions. These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular, insoluble plaques. There are many studies proposing that megalin- and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model.4. Amyloid-Beta and MitochondriaStudies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage, induced by amyloid-beta, is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression. Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally. Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments: the outer mitochondrial membrane, intermembrane space, inner mitochondrial membrane, and the matrix. It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis, a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle, each accelerating the other, can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis.The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content, its relatively high oxygen metabolism, and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [26]. One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression, before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [27, 28]. Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [29, 30].Free radicals (compounds with an unpaired electron) or ROS are a normal part of metabolism. Mitochondria are the major source of ROS, and, in fact, mitochondrial dysfunction as well as hypometabolism has long been implicated in the onset of the familial and sporadic forms of AD [31]. mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [32]. Quantitative morphometric, molecular, and cellular analysis of mitochondria shows increased abnormal and damaged mitochondria in AD [33, 34]. Energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent, early event in AD.Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [35\u201337], suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain. Superoxide radicals might be produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III [38] and in components of the Krebs cycle, including a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [39]. In addition, superoxide radicals might be generated in the outer mitochondrial membrane. H2O2 and superoxide radicals, released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, might be carried to the cytoplasm and, ultimately, might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [26].Several lines of evidence suggest that APP and amyloid-beta are factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD (Figure 2). Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein (APP) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [30]. Multiple lines of evidence support APP and amyloid-beta as contributing factors to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD: both APP and amyloid-beta are present in mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial proteins, block mitochondrial import channels, impair mitochondrial transport, disrupt the electron transfer chain, increase ROS levels, and cause mitochondrial damage.324968.fig.002Figure 2: APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients. APP processing occurs by two pathways: a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway. In the nonamyloidogenic pathway (left), cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment (sAPP\u03b1) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues (C83). Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by \u03b3-secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide (P3) and APP intracellular domain (ACID). These products are nontoxic. The non-amyloidogenic \u03b1-secretase pathway occurs in over 90% of humans, and these individuals generally do not develop dementia. In the amyloidogenic pathway (right), cleavage occurs by \u03b2-secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment (sAPP\u03b2) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues (C99).

These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular, insoluble plaques. There are many studies proposing that megalin- and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model.4. Amyloid-Beta and MitochondriaStudies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage, induced by amyloid-beta, is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression.

APP processing occurs by two pathways: a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway. In the nonamyloidogenic pathway (left), cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment (sAPP\u03b1) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues (C83). Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by \u03b3-secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide (P3) and APP intracellular domain (ACID). These products are nontoxic.

Particularly, mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein (APP) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity. Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally. In this paper, we will outline current knowledge of the intracellular localization of amyloid-beta. Moreover, we summarize evidence from AD postmortem brain as well as animal AD models showing that amyloid-beta triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through a number of pathways such as impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, elevation of reactive oxygen species production, alteration of mitochondrial dynamics, and interaction with mitochondrial proteins. Thus, this paper supports the Alzheimer cascade mitochondrial hypothesis such as the most important early events in this disease, and probably one of the future strategies on the therapy of this neurodegenerative disease. 1. IntroductionEach year, over 10 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases. This figure is expected to grow by 20% over the next decade as the aging population increases and lives longer. This disease group is the fourth biggest killer in the developed world after heart diseases, cancer, and stroke [1]. The most common neurodegenerative diseases are AD, Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [2]. The most widely recognized is AD, which is among the principal debilitating conditions of the current century. Approximately 24 million people worldwide suffer from dementia, 60% of cases being due to AD, which occurs in 1% of individuals aged 50 to 70 years old and dramatically increases to 50% of those over 70 years old [3]. Dramatically, these numbers are estimated to increase to 15 million in the next 40 years [4].From the neuropathological point of view, AD is characterized by selective neuronal loss, marked synaptic alteration, morphological mitochondrial abnormalities, and Tau pathology. The histological hallmark lesions of AD are characterized by senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits. The extracellular amyloid plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles built up of hyperphosphorylated tau, although the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still unknown and there is still no cure. Many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes and plays an important role in the pathological process in AD, and more recently, energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent, early event in AD [1\u201311]. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging, the best established risk factor for AD. Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [12, 13]. Recently, we described that PLA2G3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of the free radical-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase- (X-XOD-) system-induced cell death, and that PLA2G3 polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Spanish case-control sample [14]. In previous studies with choroid plexus homogenates with different cases with AD in the different stages (I/0, III-IV, and V-VI), we demonstrated that in AD patients, amyloid-beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus [15], there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), and N-carboxyethyl-lysine (CEL) may result in impaired protein interactions, protein folding, and protein kinase activity; abnormal function of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [16].2. MitochondriaMitochondria are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells and function to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by oxidative phosphorylation and are thought to be derived evolutionarily from the fusion of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [17]. They are also involved in regulation of cell death via apoptosis, in the control of cell division and growth, in calcium homeostasis, haem biosynthesis, and in the formation and export of iron-sulphur clusters.Mitochondria are composed of a double lipid membrane which structures four compartments, distinct by composition and function (Figure 1). The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle. It contains many proteins like import complexes and voltage-dependent anion channels responsible for the free passage of low-molecular-weight substances (up to 5000 Da) between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space which represents a reservoir of protons establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane that is needed for the production of ATP via ATPase (complex V). Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, EndoG, and Htra2/Omi. In contrast to the permeable outer membrane, the inner mitochondrial membrane, rich in cardiolipin, provides a highly efficient barrier to the flow of small molecules and ions, including protons. This membrane is invaginated into numerous cristae increasing cell surface area. It houses the respiratory enzymes of the electron transport chain, the cofactor coenzyme Q, and many mitochondrial carriers. In the matrix, different metabolic pathways take place including the tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle [18].324968.fig.001Figure 1: Representative electromicrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure. Scale bar 200 nm.Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles in that they have their own, circular, double-stranded DNA (mtDNA) which is inherited almost exclusively down the maternal line and codes for 37 mitochondrial genes, 13 of which translate to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation [18, 19]. The remaining genes encode transfer (22 genes) and ribosomal (2 genes) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins. Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins, the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria, including those involved in DNA transcription, translation, and repair, are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol. As mtDNA is located in the mitochondria in close proximity to the electron transport chain, it is more susceptible to damage from free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation [20].Mitochondria generate energy by two closely coordinated metabolic processes: Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). OXPHOS is made up of the electron transport chain assembled in four enzymes (complex I to IV) as well as the F1F0-ATP synthase (complex V). Complexes I, III, and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins, whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane. The function of the chain is to generate cellular energy in the form of ATP. These five enzymes of the complex are connected functionally by mobile electron acceptors and donors: ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are fed into complexes I and II, respectively. Ubiquinone Q carries electrons from both complexes to complex II, and cytochrome c does it from complex III to IV reducing molecular oxygen to water. As electrons are transferred along electron transport chain, a fixed number of protons are pumped from the matrix into inner membrane space establishing a electrochemical gradient characterized with a specific electrical potential. The redox energy drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP as protons are transported back from inner membrane space into the matrix via complex V.3. Amyloid-Beta in the CytosolAccumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss, being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis. Moreover, previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain, the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells. Many studies showed amyloid-beta interaction with different receptors in the cellular membrane of the vasculature, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and glial cells where it is transported from cell surface into endosomal and lysosomal compartments [21\u201323]. The aberrant signalling of these receptors in AD triggered an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta into cytosol-inducing cellular stress underlies to neuronal dysfunction and dementia.It is described by our group and others that these receptors can be megalin, also known as low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 (LRP2) [24], LRP-1 [22], or RAGE (receptors for advanced glycation end products) [25]. The interaction of these receptors with amyloid-beta in neurons, microglia, and vascular cells accelerates and amplifies deleterious effects on neuronal and synaptic functions. These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular, insoluble plaques. There are many studies proposing that megalin- and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model.4. Amyloid-Beta and MitochondriaStudies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage, induced by amyloid-beta, is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression. Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally. Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments: the outer mitochondrial membrane, intermembrane space, inner mitochondrial membrane, and the matrix. It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis, a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle, each accelerating the other, can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis.The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content, its relatively high oxygen metabolism, and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [26]. One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression, before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [27, 28]. Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [29, 30].Free radicals (compounds with an unpaired electron) or ROS are a normal part of metabolism. Mitochondria are the major source of ROS, and, in fact, mitochondrial dysfunction as well as hypometabolism has long been implicated in the onset of the familial and sporadic forms of AD [31]. mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [32]. Quantitative morphometric, molecular, and cellular analysis of mitochondria shows increased abnormal and damaged mitochondria in AD [33, 34]. Energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent, early event in AD.Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [35\u201337], suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain. Superoxide radicals might be produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III [38] and in components of the Krebs cycle, including a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [39]. In addition, superoxide radicals might be generated in the outer mitochondrial membrane. H2O2 and superoxide radicals, released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, might be carried to the cytoplasm and, ultimately, might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [26].Several lines of evidence suggest that APP and amyloid-beta are factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD (Figure 2). Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein (APP) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [30]. Multiple lines of evidence support APP and amyloid-beta as contributing factors to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD: both APP and amyloid-beta are present in mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial proteins, block mitochondrial import channels, impair mitochondrial transport, disrupt the electron transfer chain, increase ROS levels, and cause mitochondrial damage.324968.fig.002Figure 2: APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients. APP processing occurs by two pathways: a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway. In the nonamyloidogenic pathway (left), cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment (sAPP\u03b1) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues (C83). Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by \u03b3-secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide (P3) and APP intracellular domain (ACID). These products are nontoxic. The non-amyloidogenic \u03b1-secretase pathway occurs in over 90% of humans, and these individuals generally do not develop dementia. In the amyloidogenic pathway (right), cleavage occurs by \u03b2-secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment (sAPP\u03b2) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues (C99).

They are also involved in regulation of cell death via apoptosis, in the control of cell division and growth, in calcium homeostasis, haem biosynthesis, and in the formation and export of iron-sulphur clusters.Mitochondria are composed of a double lipid membrane which structures four compartments, distinct by composition and function (Figure 1). The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle. It contains many proteins like import complexes and voltage-dependent anion channels responsible for the free passage of low-molecular-weight substances (up to 5000 Da) between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space which represents a reservoir of protons establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane that is needed for the production of ATP via ATPase (complex V). Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, EndoG, and Htra2/Omi. In contrast to the permeable outer membrane, the inner mitochondrial membrane, rich in cardiolipin, provides a highly efficient barrier to the flow of small molecules and ions, including protons. This membrane is invaginated into numerous cristae increasing cell surface area. It houses the respiratory enzymes of the electron transport chain, the cofactor coenzyme Q, and many mitochondrial carriers. In the matrix, different metabolic pathways take place including the tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle [18].324968.fig.001Figure 1: Representative electromicrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure. Scale bar 200 nm.Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles in that they have their own, circular, double-stranded DNA (mtDNA) which is inherited almost exclusively down the maternal line and codes for 37 mitochondrial genes, 13 of which translate to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation [18, 19]. The remaining genes encode transfer (22 genes) and ribosomal (2 genes) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins. Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins, the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria, including those involved in DNA transcription, translation, and repair, are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol. As mtDNA is located in the mitochondria in close proximity to the electron transport chain, it is more susceptible to damage from free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation [20].Mitochondria generate energy by two closely coordinated metabolic processes: Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). OXPHOS is made up of the electron transport chain assembled in four enzymes (complex I to IV) as well as the F1F0-ATP synthase (complex V). Complexes I, III, and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins, whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane. The function of the chain is to generate cellular energy in the form of ATP. These five enzymes of the complex are connected functionally by mobile electron acceptors and donors: ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are fed into complexes I and II, respectively. Ubiquinone Q carries electrons from both complexes to complex II, and cytochrome c does it from complex III to IV reducing molecular oxygen to water. As electrons are transferred along electron transport chain, a fixed number of protons are pumped from the matrix into inner membrane space establishing a electrochemical gradient characterized with a specific electrical potential. The redox energy drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP as protons are transported back from inner membrane space into the matrix via complex V.3. Amyloid-Beta in the CytosolAccumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss, being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis. Moreover, previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain, the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells. Many studies showed amyloid-beta interaction with different receptors in the cellular membrane of the vasculature, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and glial cells where it is transported from cell surface into endosomal and lysosomal compartments [21\u201323]. The aberrant signalling of these receptors in AD triggered an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta into cytosol-inducing cellular stress underlies to neuronal dysfunction and dementia.It is described by our group and others that these receptors can be megalin, also known as low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 (LRP2) [24], LRP-1 [22], or RAGE (receptors for advanced glycation end products) [25]. The interaction of these receptors with amyloid-beta in neurons, microglia, and vascular cells accelerates and amplifies deleterious effects on neuronal and synaptic functions. These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular, insoluble plaques. There are many studies proposing that megalin- and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model.4. Amyloid-Beta and MitochondriaStudies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage, induced by amyloid-beta, is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression. Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally. Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments: the outer mitochondrial membrane, intermembrane space, inner mitochondrial membrane, and the matrix. It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis, a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle, each accelerating the other, can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis.The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content, its relatively high oxygen metabolism, and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [26]. One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression, before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [27, 28]. Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [29, 30].Free radicals (compounds with an unpaired electron) or ROS are a normal part of metabolism. Mitochondria are the major source of ROS, and, in fact, mitochondrial dysfunction as well as hypometabolism has long been implicated in the onset of the familial and sporadic forms of AD [31]. mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [32]. Quantitative morphometric, molecular, and cellular analysis of mitochondria shows increased abnormal and damaged mitochondria in AD [33, 34]. Energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent, early event in AD.Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [35\u201337], suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain. Superoxide radicals might be produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III [38] and in components of the Krebs cycle, including a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [39]. In addition, superoxide radicals might be generated in the outer mitochondrial membrane. H2O2 and superoxide radicals, released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, might be carried to the cytoplasm and, ultimately, might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [26].Several lines of evidence suggest that APP and amyloid-beta are factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD (Figure 2). Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein (APP) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [30]. Multiple lines of evidence support APP and amyloid-beta as contributing factors to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD: both APP and amyloid-beta are present in mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial proteins, block mitochondrial import channels, impair mitochondrial transport, disrupt the electron transfer chain, increase ROS levels, and cause mitochondrial damage.324968.fig.002Figure 2: APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients. APP processing occurs by two pathways: a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway. In the nonamyloidogenic pathway (left), cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment (sAPP\u03b1) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues (C83). Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by \u03b3-secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide (P3) and APP intracellular domain (ACID). These products are nontoxic. The non-amyloidogenic \u03b1-secretase pathway occurs in over 90% of humans, and these individuals generally do not develop dementia. In the amyloidogenic pathway (right), cleavage occurs by \u03b2-secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment (sAPP\u03b2) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues (C99).

Particularly, mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein (APP) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity. Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally. In this paper, we will outline current knowledge of the intracellular localization of amyloid-beta. Moreover, we summarize evidence from AD postmortem brain as well as animal AD models showing that amyloid-beta triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through a number of pathways such as impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, elevation of reactive oxygen species production, alteration of mitochondrial dynamics, and interaction with mitochondrial proteins. Thus, this paper supports the Alzheimer cascade mitochondrial hypothesis such as the most important early events in this disease, and probably one of the future strategies on the therapy of this neurodegenerative disease. 1. IntroductionEach year, over 10 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases. This figure is expected to grow by 20% over the next decade as the aging population increases and lives longer. This disease group is the fourth biggest killer in the developed world after heart diseases, cancer, and stroke [1]. The most common neurodegenerative diseases are AD, Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [2]. The most widely recognized is AD, which is among the principal debilitating conditions of the current century. Approximately 24 million people worldwide suffer from dementia, 60% of cases being due to AD, which occurs in 1% of individuals aged 50 to 70 years old and dramatically increases to 50% of those over 70 years old [3]. Dramatically, these numbers are estimated to increase to 15 million in the next 40 years [4].From the neuropathological point of view, AD is characterized by selective neuronal loss, marked synaptic alteration, morphological mitochondrial abnormalities, and Tau pathology. The histological hallmark lesions of AD are characterized by senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits. The extracellular amyloid plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles built up of hyperphosphorylated tau, although the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still unknown and there is still no cure. Many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes and plays an important role in the pathological process in AD, and more recently, energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent, early event in AD [1\u201311]. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging, the best established risk factor for AD. Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [12, 13]. Recently, we described that PLA2G3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of the free radical-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase- (X-XOD-) system-induced cell death, and that PLA2G3 polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Spanish case-control sample [14]. In previous studies with choroid plexus homogenates with different cases with AD in the different stages (I/0, III-IV, and V-VI), we demonstrated that in AD patients, amyloid-beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus [15], there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), and N-carboxyethyl-lysine (CEL) may result in impaired protein interactions, protein folding, and protein kinase activity; abnormal function of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [16].2.

Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments: the outer mitochondrial membrane, intermembrane space, inner mitochondrial membrane, and the matrix. It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis, a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle, each accelerating the other, can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis.The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content, its relatively high oxygen metabolism, and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [26]. One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression, before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [27, 28]. Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [29, 30].Free radicals (compounds with an unpaired electron) or ROS are a normal part of metabolism. Mitochondria are the major source of ROS, and, in fact, mitochondrial dysfunction as well as hypometabolism has long been implicated in the onset of the familial and sporadic forms of AD [31]. mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [32]. Quantitative morphometric, molecular, and cellular analysis of mitochondria shows increased abnormal and damaged mitochondria in AD [33, 34]. Energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent, early event in AD.Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [35\u201337], suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain. Superoxide radicals might be produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III [38] and in components of the Krebs cycle, including a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [39]. In addition, superoxide radicals might be generated in the outer mitochondrial membrane. H2O2 and superoxide radicals, released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, might be carried to the cytoplasm and, ultimately, might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [26].Several lines of evidence suggest that APP and amyloid-beta are factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD (Figure 2). Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein (APP) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [30]. Multiple lines of evidence support APP and amyloid-beta as contributing factors to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD: both APP and amyloid-beta are present in mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial proteins, block mitochondrial import channels, impair mitochondrial transport, disrupt the electron transfer chain, increase ROS levels, and cause mitochondrial damage.324968.fig.002Figure 2: APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients. APP processing occurs by two pathways: a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway. In the nonamyloidogenic pathway (left), cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment (sAPP\u03b1) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues (C83). Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by \u03b3-secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide (P3) and APP intracellular domain (ACID). These products are nontoxic. The non-amyloidogenic \u03b1-secretase pathway occurs in over 90% of humans, and these individuals generally do not develop dementia. In the amyloidogenic pathway (right), cleavage occurs by \u03b2-secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment (sAPP\u03b2) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues (C99).

Particularly, mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein (APP) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity. Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally. In this paper, we will outline current knowledge of the intracellular localization of amyloid-beta. Moreover, we summarize evidence from AD postmortem brain as well as animal AD models showing that amyloid-beta triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through a number of pathways such as impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, elevation of reactive oxygen species production, alteration of mitochondrial dynamics, and interaction with mitochondrial proteins. Thus, this paper supports the Alzheimer cascade mitochondrial hypothesis such as the most important early events in this disease, and probably one of the future strategies on the therapy of this neurodegenerative disease. 1. IntroductionEach year, over 10 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases. This figure is expected to grow by 20% over the next decade as the aging population increases and lives longer. This disease group is the fourth biggest killer in the developed world after heart diseases, cancer, and stroke [1]. The most common neurodegenerative diseases are AD, Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [2]. The most widely recognized is AD, which is among the principal debilitating conditions of the current century. Approximately 24 million people worldwide suffer from dementia, 60% of cases being due to AD, which occurs in 1% of individuals aged 50 to 70 years old and dramatically increases to 50% of those over 70 years old [3]. Dramatically, these numbers are estimated to increase to 15 million in the next 40 years [4].From the neuropathological point of view, AD is characterized by selective neuronal loss, marked synaptic alteration, morphological mitochondrial abnormalities, and Tau pathology. The histological hallmark lesions of AD are characterized by senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits. The extracellular amyloid plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles built up of hyperphosphorylated tau, although the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still unknown and there is still no cure. Many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes and plays an important role in the pathological process in AD, and more recently, energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent, early event in AD [1\u201311]. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging, the best established risk factor for AD. Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [12, 13]. Recently, we described that PLA2G3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of the free radical-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase- (X-XOD-) system-induced cell death, and that PLA2G3 polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Spanish case-control sample [14]. In previous studies with choroid plexus homogenates with different cases with AD in the different stages (I/0, III-IV, and V-VI), we demonstrated that in AD patients, amyloid-beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus [15], there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), and N-carboxyethyl-lysine (CEL) may result in impaired protein interactions, protein folding, and protein kinase activity; abnormal function of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [16].2. MitochondriaMitochondria are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells and function to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by oxidative phosphorylation and are thought to be derived evolutionarily from the fusion of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [17]. They are also involved in regulation of cell death via apoptosis, in the control of cell division and growth, in calcium homeostasis, haem biosynthesis, and in the formation and export of iron-sulphur clusters.Mitochondria are composed of a double lipid membrane which structures four compartments, distinct by composition and function (Figure 1). The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle. It contains many proteins like import complexes and voltage-dependent anion channels responsible for the free passage of low-molecular-weight substances (up to 5000 Da) between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space which represents a reservoir of protons establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane that is needed for the production of ATP via ATPase (complex V). Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, EndoG, and Htra2/Omi. In contrast to the permeable outer membrane, the inner mitochondrial membrane, rich in cardiolipin, provides a highly efficient barrier to the flow of small molecules and ions, including protons. This membrane is invaginated into numerous cristae increasing cell surface area. It houses the respiratory enzymes of the electron transport chain, the cofactor coenzyme Q, and many mitochondrial carriers. In the matrix, different metabolic pathways take place including the tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle [18].324968.fig.001Figure 1: Representative electromicrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure. Scale bar 200 nm.Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles in that they have their own, circular, double-stranded DNA (mtDNA) which is inherited almost exclusively down the maternal line and codes for 37 mitochondrial genes, 13 of which translate to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation [18, 19]. The remaining genes encode transfer (22 genes) and ribosomal (2 genes) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins. Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins, the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria, including those involved in DNA transcription, translation, and repair, are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol. As mtDNA is located in the mitochondria in close proximity to the electron transport chain, it is more susceptible to damage from free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation [20].Mitochondria generate energy by two closely coordinated metabolic processes: Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). OXPHOS is made up of the electron transport chain assembled in four enzymes (complex I to IV) as well as the F1F0-ATP synthase (complex V). Complexes I, III, and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins, whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane. The function of the chain is to generate cellular energy in the form of ATP. These five enzymes of the complex are connected functionally by mobile electron acceptors and donors: ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are fed into complexes I and II, respectively. Ubiquinone Q carries electrons from both complexes to complex II, and cytochrome c does it from complex III to IV reducing molecular oxygen to water. As electrons are transferred along electron transport chain, a fixed number of protons are pumped from the matrix into inner membrane space establishing a electrochemical gradient characterized with a specific electrical potential. The redox energy drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP as protons are transported back from inner membrane space into the matrix via complex V.3. Amyloid-Beta in the CytosolAccumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss, being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis. Moreover, previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain, the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells. Many studies showed amyloid-beta interaction with different receptors in the cellular membrane of the vasculature, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and glial cells where it is transported from cell surface into endosomal and lysosomal compartments [21\u201323]. The aberrant signalling of these receptors in AD triggered an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta into cytosol-inducing cellular stress underlies to neuronal dysfunction and dementia.It is described by our group and others that these receptors can be megalin, also known as low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 (LRP2) [24], LRP-1 [22], or RAGE (receptors for advanced glycation end products) [25]. The interaction of these receptors with amyloid-beta in neurons, microglia, and vascular cells accelerates and amplifies deleterious effects on neuronal and synaptic functions. These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular, insoluble plaques. There are many studies proposing that megalin- and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model.4. Amyloid-Beta and MitochondriaStudies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage, induced by amyloid-beta, is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression. Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally. Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments: the outer mitochondrial membrane, intermembrane space, inner mitochondrial membrane, and the matrix. It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis, a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle, each accelerating the other, can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis.The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content, its relatively high oxygen metabolism, and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [26].

APP processing occurs by two pathways: a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway. In the nonamyloidogenic pathway (left), cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment (sAPP\u03b1) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues (C83). Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by \u03b3-secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide (P3) and APP intracellular domain (ACID). These products are nontoxic. The non-amyloidogenic \u03b1-secretase pathway occurs in over 90% of humans, and these individuals generally do not develop dementia. In the amyloidogenic pathway (right), cleavage occurs by \u03b2-secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment (sAPP\u03b2) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues (C99).

Fraering*\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Brain Mind Institute, Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Alzheimer's Disease, Lausanne, SwitzerlandAbstract Top BackgroundMutations linked to early onset, familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are found most frequently in PSEN1, the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1). Together with nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the \u03b3-secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides. Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A\u03b2 production by enhancing the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain (AICD). Moreover, controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems, by either increasing A\u03b21\u201342 production, decreasing A\u03b21\u201340 production, or both. Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of \u03b3-secretase, we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT, APH1aL, PEN2, and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P, \u0394E9, or P436Q.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations. A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes. The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of \u03b3-secretase activity phenotype, in terms of A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro.Conclusion/SignificanceOur data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong \u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.Citation: Cacquevel M, Aeschbach L, Houacine J, Fraering PC (2012) Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified \u03b3-Secretase Complexes.

PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2, respectively, that constitute the catalytic core of \u03b3-secretase, the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional, Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases (I-CLiPs) [3]. Active \u03b3-secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin (NCT), the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and the presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2). Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue \u03b3-secretase inhibitors to PS1 [4], as well as the abolishment of \u03b3-secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [4], [5], [6], have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex.PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the \u03b3-secretase complex. The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [7], releasing their corresponding intracellular domains, which are capable of influencing gene expression. For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4, the \u03b3-secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function, whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3\u03b2 [8], the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established (see [9] for a review). The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by the successive actions of \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase, generating amyloid-beta peptides (A\u03b2) of different lengths, ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [10]. Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) by \u03b3-secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression, a major genetic determinant of AD, and in cholesterol metabolism [11]. In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate \u03b3-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].In a pathological context, 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD (www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations). It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A\u03b2 species, mainly A\u03b21\u201342, that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of the disease [15], [16]. Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Despite this growing consensus, the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A\u03b242, A\u03b240, and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations. On one hand, a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A\u03b242 production, accompanied or not with reduced A\u03b240 production, thereby leading to an increased A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio. On the other hand, reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [20]. Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A\u03b2 and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects. For example, endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis, as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A\u03b2 generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [23]. Next, it has been reported that \u03b3-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition (with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms, six combinations of \u03b3-secretase are possible), with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A\u03b2 species generated [24]. In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of \u03b3-secretase in cell-free systems, we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [25], [26], [27]. In particular, protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active \u03b3-secretase constituted of NCT, APH1aL, PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [26], [27] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 \u00c5 and 12 \u00c5 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [28], [29]. However, these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1. Here, we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human \u03b3-secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of \u03b3-secretase activity.Results Top Generation, selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutantsIn order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human \u03b3-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants, we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line that lacks the two presenilins (PS1/2\u2212/\u2212) [30], [31]. Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines, on a PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 background, that overexpress tagged versions of the three human \u03b3-secretase subunits NCT, APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1, and to purify the different human \u03b3-secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps. This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse \u03b3-secretase components. First, a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 (hNCT-V5), human APH1aL-HA (hAPH1aL-HA) and human Flag-PEN2 (Flag-hPEN2) into MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time. Next, the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected (designated \u03b3 - PS1/2) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants: PS1-WT, three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial, catalytic site aspartate residues (D257A, D385A, and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article), and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, \u0394E9 and P436Q, with mean disease onset at 24 years, 45.5 years and 28.3 years, respectively).For each PS1 variant, two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins, and extensively characterized (Figure 1). To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all \u03b3-sectease components from wild-type MEFs, they are collectively designated \u03b3-MEFs. As shown in Figure 1A, the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [23], [32]. As expected, and when compared to the parental \u03b3- PS1/2 cell line, higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones. In contrast to PEN2, APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line. Indeed, and as previously reported [23], [32], PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants, and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1. Interestingly, PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band, possibly reflecting a post-translational modification. Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones. First, and in sharp contrast to the other clones, those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 (PS1-FL; Figure 1A). As estimated by densitometry, the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87\u00b12% and 79\u00b17% of total PS1 (PS1-NTF+PS1-FL), respectively. Next, the PS1-\u0394E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments, as previously described [33], while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments, suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis.thumbnailFigure 1. Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human \u03b3-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5, Flag-hPEN2, hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line, designated as \u03b3- PS1/2, that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits. \u03b3- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Each clone, derived form the \u03b3- PS1/2, was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol \u03b3 and followed by the number of the clone (\u03b3-MEF) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF (WT MEF) and MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Two clones per \u03b3-secretase variant were selected for characterization. (A\u2013B) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 4\u201312% Bis-Tris or 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the \u03b3-secretase core components NCT (NCT164), PS1 (NTF, MAB1563; CTF; MAB5232), APH1aL-HA (3F10), and Flag-PEN2 (M2) (A), and endogenous APP (A8717) (B). \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone.

As expected, and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs (a common characteristic among known substrates in response to \u03b3-secretase pharmacological inhibition), the activity of \u03b3-secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental \u03b3 - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 (Figure 1B). In the clones expressing PS1-WT, APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high \u03b3-secretase activity, while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation. In PS1-\u0394E9 clones, a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed (Figure 1B). Although a poor recovery of \u03b3-secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1-\u0394E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [23], the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [34], [35]. Importantly, all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5, hAPH1aL-HA, Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other \u03b3-secretase components (cf. Figure S1A). These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the \u03b3-secretase.Next, we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A\u03b2 species. For this purpose, and as described elsewhere [36], we used an APP-based \u03b3-secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus (SPA4CT-Flag). This substrate was transduced in the above-described \u03b3-secretase overexpressing stable cell lines (\u03b3-MEFs) as well as in wild-type MEFs, and APP-CTFs and A\u03b2 levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media, respectively (Figure 2). Under these conditions, the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate, associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels (Figure 2A and Figure S2). As estimated by ELISA, a three-fold increase in A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase (\u03b3-MEF WT), in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs (Figure 2B). Also, the average A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were not significantly different in those cell lines (Mean \u00b1 SD: \u03b3-MEF WT#5: 0.30\u00b10.01; \u03b3-MEF WT#8: 0.29\u00b10.01; WT MEF: 0.19\u00b10.06). Next, overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in \u03b3-MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants (Figure 2C), and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A\u03b2 levels as measured by ELISA (Figure 2D). First, only traces of both A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were detected in \u03b3-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants. Next, \u03b3-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A\u03b2 levels when compared to the wild-type clones. Overall, the average A\u03b21\u201340 levels were decreased in these cell lines (Mean of two clones in pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 224.6\u00b10.1, L166P: 84.3\u00b134.2, \u0394E9: 167.2\u00b140.7, P436Q: 82.8\u00b174.7), while the A\u03b21\u201342 levels were increased (Mean of two clones in pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 69.9\u00b17.9, L166P: 310.7\u00b181.0, \u0394E9: 94.4\u00b118.5, P436Q: 141.1\u00b198.5). Consistent with previously reported data, the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were increased in all \u03b3-MEF clones overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations (Figure 2D) (Mean of two clones pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 0.31\u00b10.03, L166P: 3.8\u00b10.58, \u0394E9: 0.6\u00b10.03, P436Q: 2.0\u00b10.59).thumbnailFigure 2. A\u03b2 production in cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.WT MEF, \u03b3-MEF and \u03b3 - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus. Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717) (A, C). A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 levels were also measured in the corresponding cell culture media (B, D). Data corresponds to three independent experiments (Mean \u00b1 SEM).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified \u03b3-secretase complexesWe next assessed the activity of \u03b3-secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of \u03b3-MEFs. Membrane protein extracts were prepared and \u03b3-secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP, and referred to as C100-Flag (Figure 3A). The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry. As shown in Figure 3A, the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1-\u0394E9 clones accounted for 42\u00b11% and 13\u00b16% of that in the PS1-WT clones, respectively. AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants. Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other human \u03b3-secretase components (Figure S1B).thumbnailFigure 3. Enzymatic activity of partially purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) \u03b3-Secretase activity assays performed with \u03b3-MEF and \u03b3 - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with lipids and 1 \u00b5M of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions, reflecting \u03b3-secretase activity, were estimated by densitometry. PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. (B) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4\u00b0C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins, and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in (A). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for \u03b3-secretase subunits ((NCT164 (NCT), MAB1563 (PS1-NTF), or UD1 (PEN2)). AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody (A8717). *Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains. (C) A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL (left Y-axis) or in percentage (right Y-axis) of the mean of A\u03b21\u201340 levels generated by the two wild-type clones. A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios are indicated on the top of the bars. The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions. To do so, \u03b3-secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate. Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins (anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10, targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of \u03b3-secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions. As shown in Figure 3B, the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT, PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the \u03b3-secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used (Figures 3B). In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts (Figure 3A), those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation, when compared to PS1-WT (Figure 3B). Furthermore, levels of A\u03b21\u201340 produced from PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~6%, ~1.5% and ~0.5%, when compared to these produced from PS1-WT \u03b3-secretase. Following the same tendency, A\u03b21\u201342 levels generated from PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9 and PS1-P436Q \u03b3-secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~20%, ~5% and ~3% of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes. The A\u03b21-42/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio measured for WT \u03b3-MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data (compare Figures 2D and 3C), validating our in vitro experimental conditions. Interestingly, an overall A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio of ~1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants, with the exception of P436Q#4 (~2). However, in the latter, the ratio may have been overestimated because the A\u03b21\u201340 levels measured were at the detection limit. This similarity in the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios generated by the different mutants has, to the best of our knowledge, never been observed in previous studies.Highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotypeIn order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions, we purified to homogeneity \u03b3-secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1. The purification process (described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts. Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background, this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively \u03b3-secretase complexes made of human components. As highlighted in Figure 4B, our protocol led to the production of stable, high molecular weight \u03b3-secretase complexes (HMWCs) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native (BN)-PAGE of ~350 kDa, which is consistent with previous reports [26], [27], [37]. The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes (Figure 4B, upper panel), for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 (Figure 4B, lower panels). As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different \u03b3-secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates, it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar (Figure 4B), thus facilitating further comparative analyses. The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes (Figure 4C) confirmed the presence of all core components (NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, Flag-PEN2 and PS1) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1. Interestingly, the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified \u03b3-secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification (Figure 1A), indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations. To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect \u03b3-secretase activity in these purified complexes, we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate (Figure 3A) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes, immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity. As shown in Figure 5A, \u03b3-secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones. This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions (Figure 5A). Next, sandwich ELISAs directed against A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes. Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA, the production of both A\u03b2 species by \u03b3-secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants (Figure 5B). The A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio measured in PS1-WT \u03b3-secretase complexes (~0.22) was similar to that previously reported [26], [27], thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of \u03b3-secretase activity with this protocol. Together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P, \u0394E9, and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss (at least 90% as estimated by ELISA) of \u03b3-secretase activity.thumbnailFigure 4. High-grade purification of human \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) Schematic representation of the \u03b3-secretase purification process. Briefly, Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human \u03b3-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants. Next, these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods. (B) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified \u03b3-secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants. Equal volumes of the different purified \u03b3-secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4\u201316% Bis-Tris gel, and stained with silver nitrate (top panel), or immunostained for NCT (NCT164, middle panel) or PS1-NTF (ab10281, bottom panel) as indicated. \u03b3-Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes (HMWCs) of ~350 kDa. Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones. (C) Equal volumes of purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) and immunostained with anti-NCT (NCT164), anti-PS1-NTF (MAB1563), anti-PS1-CTF (MAB5232), anti-HA (3F10), or anti-Flag (M2) antibodies. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g004 thumbnailFigure 5. Enzymatic activity of highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants.Equal amounts of the different purified \u03b3-secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag, as described in Figure 3. The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody (M2) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag (A), and by sandwich ELISA for A\u03b21\u201340 or A\u03b21\u201342 (B). Note that the levels of A\u03b2 produced from FAD-linked \u03b3-secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards, close to the detection limit. Whenever possible, A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by \u03b3-secretase have been reported. First, it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A\u03b21\u201342 [15], [38]. Since A\u03b21\u201342, the first A\u03b2 specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [16], [39], is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A\u03b2 species [40], [41], [42], it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [43]. This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A\u03b2 accumulation and deposition in the brain [44], [45]. However, Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A\u03b2 production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [23]. These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo. By extension, we hypothesized that the other components of \u03b3-secretase, namely APH1, NCT and PEN2, may influence the mutant phenotype as well. Indeed, \u03b3-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2. Therefore, it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct \u03b3-secretase subtypes. This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A\u03b2 profiles. When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A\u03b2 species [24]. With this regard, it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [23] and employed here (cf. Figure S3). Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems, we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems, by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human \u03b3-secretase components. Under these conditions, the biochemical and functional properties of \u03b3-secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, \u0394E9, and P436Q), dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized. The activity of \u03b3-secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for \u03b3-secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5, APH1aL, Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [26], [27], that resulted in A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3. In contrast, we found a major loss in the activity of \u03b3-secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of \u03b3-secretase [5], [6], [32], the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected. Indeed, the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A\u03b21\u201342 levels both in vivo [46] and in vitro [20], in the presence of endogenous PS1, PS2 and APH1 components. In contrast, Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 production in a PS knockout background. These results are consistent with our in vitro data, although the reduction in A\u03b21\u201342 and A\u03b21\u201340 production was more pronounced in our system. However, they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A\u03b21\u201342 associated with a decrease in A\u03b21\u201340. Taken together, these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of \u03b3-secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations. Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use, in previously described cellular systems, of APP carrying the Swedish mutation (K670M/N671L) [20], [23], [46]. Initially, this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A\u03b2 species by favouring its \u03b2-secretase cleavage [47], [48]. However, Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the \u03b3-secretase cleavage [49]. In particular, these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A\u03b242, associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A\u03b2, compared with the wild-type APP. Therefore, one cannot exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants, as suggested earlier [50].As far as the PS1-\u0394E9 mutant is concerned, previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A\u03b240 levels associated with an increase in A\u03b242 levels [51], [52], or no changes in A\u03b240 levels despite increased A\u03b242 levels [53], or a decrease in both A\u03b2 species [23]. In the present study, A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342, as well as AICD levels generated from purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with PS1-\u0394E9 were close to the limit of detection, resulting in a loss of at least 95% of the \u03b3-secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1. Similarly, we found a near to complete loss of \u03b3-secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant (mean onset: 28.3 years) [54]. Consistent with a recent study [35], and in contrast to PS1-L166P, the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired. Interestingly, the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased \u03b3-secretase activity and A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells (~75% or ~50% of the control for A\u03b240 or A\u03b242, respectively), but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study (more than 97% for both A\u03b2 species).Overall, our data show that, under our experimental conditions, the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity (at least 90%) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified \u03b3-secretase complexes. This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A\u03b21\u201342 levels were relatively less affected than A\u03b21\u201340 levels. Interestingly, the ratio between the two A\u03b2 species was similar for the variants tested here (~1), suggesting a common modulatory mechanism. Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of \u03b3-secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio compared to PS1-WT, as previously observed in vivo [15], [38]. Taken together, the overall reduction in A\u03b2 levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions. Indeed, even if A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions, A\u03b2 production was strikingly different.One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of \u03b3-secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations. For instance, it remains unknown whether \u03b3-secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations. In support to that regard, Winkler and colleagues recently purified human \u03b3-secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes, containing both APH1a and AHP1b, led to increased A\u03b21\u201342 production associated with decreased A\u03b21\u201340 production, as compared to the PS1-WT complexes. Another possible explanation would be that purified \u03b3-secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates, due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins. These include TMP21 or the recently reported \u03b3-secretase activating protein (GSAP) [12], [13]. Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis.The loss of activity in \u03b3-secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD. As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes, including the neprilysin [55], and the lipoprotein receptor, LRP1 [11], it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo. For instance, it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A\u03b2 metabolism in return. In support to these views, Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants, albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [56]. They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone, suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions. These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [57]. Altogether, the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of \u03b3-secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD. They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting \u03b3-secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [58]. Supporting this view, the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, but actually made it worse [59].Collectively, our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A\u03b2 pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A\u03b2 species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by \u03b3-secretase substrates. This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease. Since it has been established that A\u03b2 and AICD are generated following the processing by \u03b3-secretase at two distinct gamma- and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [60], further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP, as well as in other known \u03b3-secretase substrates.Materials and Methods Top DNA Constructs and mutagenesisNCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA, wild-type PS1 human cDNAs (PS1-WT) were obtained from D. Selkoe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). PS1 \u0394E9 cDNA was obtained from C. Saura (Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Spain). PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A cDNAs were obtained from M. Wolfe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). Mutations in PSEN1, namely, L166P and P436Q, were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis on the plasmid pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)-PS1-WT using T7 or BGH primers (specific to the plasmid DNA sequence) together with the corresponding primers: L166P Rv: 5\u2032 CAG CAA CAA Taa gct tGA TAT AAT AGG 3\u2032; L166P Fw: 5\u2032 CTT ATT ATA TCa agc ttA TTG TTG CTG 3\u2032; P436Q Rv: 5\u2032 TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTC TTG AAA ATG GCA AGG AG 3\u2032; P436Q Fw: 5\u2032 TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTG CCA GCT CTT CAA ATC TCC 3\u2032. The sequences corresponding to enzyme restriction sites are given in small letters. The PCR fragments were next digested with BamHI/HindIII and HindIII/XhoI respectively, and were subcloned into pcDNA3. PS1 D257A/D385A (DDAA) was obtained by subcloning the DraI/XhoI digested fragment of PS1 D385A into pcDNA3.1-PS1 D257A. The APP based substrate SPA4CT-Flag, corresponding to the signal peptide of APP fused to the APP-C99-Flag with a small linker region (DA) [36], was obtained by removing the HindIII/EcoRI fragment of pcDNA3-APP695-Flag and inserting the following annealed primers: 5\u2032 AGC TTA TGC TGC CCG GTT TG GCA CTG CTC CTG CTG GCC GCC TGG ACG GCT CGG GCG GAT GCA GAT GCA G 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 AAT TCT GCA TCT GCA TCC GCC CGA GCC GTC CAG GCG GCC AGC AGG AGC AGT GCC AAA CCG GGC AGC ATA 3\u2032. All constructs were next subcloned into the self-inactivated vector pSIN-PGK-WHV cassette (a kind gift from R. Zufferey, Brain Mind Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland). Inserts for plasmids pET21-C100-Flag, and pET21-C100-His were generated by PCR as previously described [27]. Plasmids pMD2G and psPAX2 were obtained from D. Trono (Global Health Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland).Lentivector productionReplication-defective lentiviral particles were produced by a three-plasmid transient transfection of cells from the human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cell line [61]. Briefly, cells were incubated in 10 cm dishes until they reached 70% confluence and were transiently co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method, with 5 \u00b5g of envelope plasmid (pMD2G), 15 \u00b5g of packaging plasmid (psPAX2), and 20 \u00b5g of vector plasmids (pSIN-PGK-WHV). Cells were incubated overnight with DNA-calcium precipitates, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) and incubated with 7 mL of DMEM. After 24 h, the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled, passed through 0.45 \u00b5m filter, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C as 2 mL aliquots until use. A p24 ELISA (Zeptometrix corporation) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated.Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductionsMouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs, obtained from B. De Strooper, Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology, Belgium) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [30], [31] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen). A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors (LV) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage (1/20). Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection. The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins (designated \u03b3 - PS1/2) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants, by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT, PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9, PS1-P436Q, PS1-D257A, PS1-D385A, and PS1-DDAA. For each PS1 variant, five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for \u03b3-secretase purification. For SPA4CT overexpression experiments, 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM, 1% FBS, P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM, 2% FBS, P/S for 24 h. Finally, cell culture medium was harvested, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000\u00d7 rpm and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing. Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction.Protein extractionTotal protein extracts were prepared in 1% NP40 - HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000\u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7 g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).Multi-step purification of human \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1) Cell membrane preparation. MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells (1.0\u00d7109 cells) expressing NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1: wild type (WT), or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues, were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer (50 mM MES, pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Next, cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer (Emulsiflex-C5, Avestin Inc, ON Canada) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000\u00d7 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C in a SW32Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet. 2) Bicarbonate wash. The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 11.3) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times, and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. 3) Solubilisation of \u03b3-secretase complexes. The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times. The membranes were then incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant saved. This lysate is defined as \u201csolubilised \u03b3-secretase preparation\u201d. Next, these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of \u03b3-secretase complexes as described below. 4) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification. The solubilised \u03b3-secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer, and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) (final detergent concentration: 0.08% CHAPSO, 0.08% digitonin) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with agitation after adding 200 \u00b5L of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 \u00b5g/mL of Flag peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated \u201cM2 pooled 800 \u00b5L fractions\u201d. 5) Anti-V5 affinity purification. The M2 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1 mL with 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with 200 \u00b5L of anti-V5 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin-TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted for 1 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 500 \u00b5g/mL of V5 peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated 4 times, and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated \u201cV5 pooled 1.6 mL fractions\u201d. 6) Anti-HA affinity purification. As a final purification step, the V5 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1.8 mL with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with 200 \u00b5L of anti-HA affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted overnight at 4\u00b0C with 0.2 mL of this buffer containing 200 \u00b5g/mL of HA peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once, for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, and the two eluted fractions were kept separately, designated \u201cHA fraction E1\u201d and \u201cHA fraction E2\u201d.Co-immunoprecipitationCo-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts. Briefly, 100 \u00b5g of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche), and 50 \u00b5L of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. Samples were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer. Finally, beads were resuspended in 50 \u00b5L of 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro \u03b3-secretase assays.In vitro \u03b3-secretase activity assaysIn vitro \u03b3-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27]. \u03b3-Secretase APP-based substrates were expressed in E. coli transfected with plasmids pET21-C100-Flag or pET21-C100-His as a fusion protein consisting of a Met for translation initiation, and either the Flag tag sequence (C100-Flag) or the His tag sequence (C100-His), and were affinity purified using an anti-Flag resin (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) or an Ni-NTA agarose resin (Invitrogen), respectively. In vitro assays were performed at 37\u00b0C for 4 h, with 1 \u00b5M of recombinant substrate, 0.025% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and 0.1% phosphatidylcholine (PC). \u03b3-Secretase activity was quantified by measuring the amount of AICD and A\u03b2 generated during the reaction, by immunoblot or sandwich ELISA respectively, as described below.SDS-PAGE, Native PAGE, Western blotting and antibodiesTotal or microsomal protein extracts were resolved by electrophoresis on NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen) or on standard 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide Tris Glycine gels for SDS-PAGE analysis. Purified \u03b3-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE\u2122 Novex\u00ae Bis-Tris 4\u201316% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen). Silver staining was performed directly on gel according to manufacturer instructions (Biorad). For immunoblot analysis, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (Whatman), and probed with the following antibodies: anti-Nicastrin NCT164 (BD Bioscience), anti-V5-tag for NCT-V5 (Covance), MAB1563 (Millipore) or ab10281 (Abcam) for PS1 NTF, MAB5232 for PS1 CTF (Millipore), 3F10 for APH1aL-HA (Roche), anti-Flag M2 for Flag-PEN-2 or C100-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich), A8717 for APP CTF (Sigma-Aldrich), and A2066 for \u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Anti-mouse/rabbit/rat IgG conjugated to Alexa 680 were purchased from Invitrogen. The Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR) was used to detect the fluorescent signal.Quantification of A\u03b2 peptidesA\u03b2 peptides from the \u03b3-secretase assays described above were quantified by sandwich ELISA according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Three kits were used to detect human A\u03b21\u201340 (Invitrogen KHB3481) and A\u03b21\u201342 (Invitrogen KHB3544 and Wako 269-64401).Supporting Information Top Figure S1. Characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing human FAD-linked PS1 variants in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Presenilin double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Two clones per PS1 variant were selected for characterization. (A) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with various antibodies to detect the endogenous \u03b3-secretase core components: NCT (NCT164), hPS1 (NTF, MAB1563), and PEN2 (UD1), and with an antibody for APP (A8717). \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. (B) \u03b3-Secretase activity assays were performed with microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with lipids and 1 \u00b5M of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. * Indicates a non-specific band, which was not detected in microsomal protein extracts of the same cell lines using the same antibody (MAB1563) (B).

APP-CTF profiles in WT MEF, MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 and \u03b3 - PS1/2 transduced with the SPA4CT construct. WT MEF, MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 and \u03b3 - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]). Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717).(TIF)Figure S3. APH1 isoforms expressed in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Total RNAs were extracted from presenilin double-knockout MEFs, using standard procedures (Qiagen RNAeasy kit) and were quantified by spectrophotometry. One microgram of total RNAs was reverse transcribed for 1 h at 42\u00b0C by using the ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega) and oligo-dT primer in a final volume of 20 \u00b5L. PCR was next performed for each APH1 isoform on 1 \u00b5L of RT reaction by using the Roche PCR kit under standard conditions and the primers described in Table S1. The following cycling conditions were applied for all reactions: 94\u00b0C, 3 min; 30 cycles of [94\u00b0C, 30 s; 58\u00b0C, 30 s; 70\u00b0C, 40 s]; 70\u00b0C, 10 min. PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized using Alpha Innotech UV imager.(TIF)Table S1. Primers used to detect APH1 isoforms in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212.

Fraering*\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Brain Mind Institute, Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Alzheimer's Disease, Lausanne, SwitzerlandAbstract Top BackgroundMutations linked to early onset, familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are found most frequently in PSEN1, the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1). Together with nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the \u03b3-secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides. Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A\u03b2 production by enhancing the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain (AICD). Moreover, controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems, by either increasing A\u03b21\u201342 production, decreasing A\u03b21\u201340 production, or both. Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of \u03b3-secretase, we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT, APH1aL, PEN2, and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P, \u0394E9, or P436Q.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations. A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes. The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of \u03b3-secretase activity phenotype, in terms of A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro.Conclusion/SignificanceOur data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong \u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.Citation: Cacquevel M, Aeschbach L, Houacine J, Fraering PC (2012) Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified \u03b3-Secretase Complexes.

PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2, respectively, that constitute the catalytic core of \u03b3-secretase, the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional, Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases (I-CLiPs) [3]. Active \u03b3-secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin (NCT), the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and the presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2). Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue \u03b3-secretase inhibitors to PS1 [4], as well as the abolishment of \u03b3-secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [4], [5], [6], have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex.PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the \u03b3-secretase complex. The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [7], releasing their corresponding intracellular domains, which are capable of influencing gene expression. For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4, the \u03b3-secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function, whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3\u03b2 [8], the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established (see [9] for a review). The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by the successive actions of \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase, generating amyloid-beta peptides (A\u03b2) of different lengths, ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [10]. Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) by \u03b3-secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression, a major genetic determinant of AD, and in cholesterol metabolism [11]. In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate \u03b3-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].In a pathological context, 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD (www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations). It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A\u03b2 species, mainly A\u03b21\u201342, that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of the disease [15], [16]. Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Despite this growing consensus, the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A\u03b242, A\u03b240, and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations. On one hand, a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A\u03b242 production, accompanied or not with reduced A\u03b240 production, thereby leading to an increased A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio. On the other hand, reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [20]. Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A\u03b2 and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects. For example, endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis, as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A\u03b2 generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [23]. Next, it has been reported that \u03b3-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition (with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms, six combinations of \u03b3-secretase are possible), with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A\u03b2 species generated [24]. In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of \u03b3-secretase in cell-free systems, we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [25], [26], [27]. In particular, protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active \u03b3-secretase constituted of NCT, APH1aL, PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [26], [27] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 \u00c5 and 12 \u00c5 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [28], [29]. However, these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1. Here, we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human \u03b3-secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of \u03b3-secretase activity.Results Top Generation, selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutantsIn order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human \u03b3-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants, we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line that lacks the two presenilins (PS1/2\u2212/\u2212) [30], [31]. Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines, on a PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 background, that overexpress tagged versions of the three human \u03b3-secretase subunits NCT, APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1, and to purify the different human \u03b3-secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps. This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse \u03b3-secretase components. First, a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 (hNCT-V5), human APH1aL-HA (hAPH1aL-HA) and human Flag-PEN2 (Flag-hPEN2) into MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time. Next, the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected (designated \u03b3 - PS1/2) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants: PS1-WT, three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial, catalytic site aspartate residues (D257A, D385A, and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article), and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, \u0394E9 and P436Q, with mean disease onset at 24 years, 45.5 years and 28.3 years, respectively).For each PS1 variant, two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins, and extensively characterized (Figure 1). To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all \u03b3-sectease components from wild-type MEFs, they are collectively designated \u03b3-MEFs. As shown in Figure 1A, the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [23], [32]. As expected, and when compared to the parental \u03b3- PS1/2 cell line, higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones. In contrast to PEN2, APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line. Indeed, and as previously reported [23], [32], PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants, and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1. Interestingly, PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band, possibly reflecting a post-translational modification. Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones. First, and in sharp contrast to the other clones, those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 (PS1-FL; Figure 1A). As estimated by densitometry, the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87\u00b12% and 79\u00b17% of total PS1 (PS1-NTF+PS1-FL), respectively. Next, the PS1-\u0394E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments, as previously described [33], while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments, suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis.thumbnailFigure 1. Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human \u03b3-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5, Flag-hPEN2, hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line, designated as \u03b3- PS1/2, that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits. \u03b3- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Each clone, derived form the \u03b3- PS1/2, was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol \u03b3 and followed by the number of the clone (\u03b3-MEF) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF (WT MEF) and MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Two clones per \u03b3-secretase variant were selected for characterization. (A\u2013B) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 4\u201312% Bis-Tris or 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the \u03b3-secretase core components NCT (NCT164), PS1 (NTF, MAB1563; CTF; MAB5232), APH1aL-HA (3F10), and Flag-PEN2 (M2) (A), and endogenous APP (A8717) (B). \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. CTF: C-terminal fragment, FL: full-length, im.: immature NCT; m.: mature NCT, N: N-glycosylated, NTF: N-terminal fragment, O: O-glycosylated.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP. As expected, and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs (a common characteristic among known substrates in response to \u03b3-secretase pharmacological inhibition), the activity of \u03b3-secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental \u03b3 - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 (Figure 1B). In the clones expressing PS1-WT, APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high \u03b3-secretase activity, while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation. In PS1-\u0394E9 clones, a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed (Figure 1B). Although a poor recovery of \u03b3-secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1-\u0394E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [23], the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [34], [35]. Importantly, all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5, hAPH1aL-HA, Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other \u03b3-secretase components (cf. Figure S1A). These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the \u03b3-secretase.Next, we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A\u03b2 species. For this purpose, and as described elsewhere [36], we used an APP-based \u03b3-secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus (SPA4CT-Flag). This substrate was transduced in the above-described \u03b3-secretase overexpressing stable cell lines (\u03b3-MEFs) as well as in wild-type MEFs, and APP-CTFs and A\u03b2 levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media, respectively (Figure 2). Under these conditions, the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate, associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels (Figure 2A and Figure S2). As estimated by ELISA, a three-fold increase in A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase (\u03b3-MEF WT), in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs (Figure 2B). Also, the average A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were not significantly different in those cell lines (Mean \u00b1 SD: \u03b3-MEF WT#5: 0.30\u00b10.01; \u03b3-MEF WT#8: 0.29\u00b10.01; WT MEF: 0.19\u00b10.06). Next, overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in \u03b3-MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants (Figure 2C), and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A\u03b2 levels as measured by ELISA (Figure 2D). First, only traces of both A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were detected in \u03b3-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants. Next, \u03b3-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A\u03b2 levels when compared to the wild-type clones. Overall, the average A\u03b21\u201340 levels were decreased in these cell lines (Mean of two clones in pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 224.6\u00b10.1, L166P: 84.3\u00b134.2, \u0394E9: 167.2\u00b140.7, P436Q: 82.8\u00b174.7), while the A\u03b21\u201342 levels were increased (Mean of two clones in pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 69.9\u00b17.9, L166P: 310.7\u00b181.0, \u0394E9: 94.4\u00b118.5, P436Q: 141.1\u00b198.5). Consistent with previously reported data, the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were increased in all \u03b3-MEF clones overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations (Figure 2D) (Mean of two clones pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 0.31\u00b10.03, L166P: 3.8\u00b10.58, \u0394E9: 0.6\u00b10.03, P436Q: 2.0\u00b10.59).thumbnailFigure 2. A\u03b2 production in cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.WT MEF, \u03b3-MEF and \u03b3 - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus. Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717) (A, C). A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 levels were also measured in the corresponding cell culture media (B, D). Data corresponds to three independent experiments (Mean \u00b1 SEM).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified \u03b3-secretase complexesWe next assessed the activity of \u03b3-secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of \u03b3-MEFs. Membrane protein extracts were prepared and \u03b3-secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP, and referred to as C100-Flag (Figure 3A). The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry. As shown in Figure 3A, the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1-\u0394E9 clones accounted for 42\u00b11% and 13\u00b16% of that in the PS1-WT clones, respectively. AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants. Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other human \u03b3-secretase components (Figure S1B).thumbnailFigure 3.

Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with lipids and 1 \u00b5M of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions, reflecting \u03b3-secretase activity, were estimated by densitometry. PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. (B) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4\u00b0C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins, and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in (A). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for \u03b3-secretase subunits ((NCT164 (NCT), MAB1563 (PS1-NTF), or UD1 (PEN2)). AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody (A8717). *Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains. (C) A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL (left Y-axis) or in percentage (right Y-axis) of the mean of A\u03b21\u201340 levels generated by the two wild-type clones. A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios are indicated on the top of the bars. The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions. To do so, \u03b3-secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate. Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins (anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10, targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of \u03b3-secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions. As shown in Figure 3B, the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT, PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the \u03b3-secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used (Figures 3B). In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts (Figure 3A), those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation, when compared to PS1-WT (Figure 3B). Furthermore, levels of A\u03b21\u201340 produced from PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~6%, ~1.5% and ~0.5%, when compared to these produced from PS1-WT \u03b3-secretase. Following the same tendency, A\u03b21\u201342 levels generated from PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9 and PS1-P436Q \u03b3-secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~20%, ~5% and ~3% of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes. The A\u03b21-42/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio measured for WT \u03b3-MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data (compare Figures 2D and 3C), validating our in vitro experimental conditions. Interestingly, an overall A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio of ~1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants, with the exception of P436Q#4 (~2). However, in the latter, the ratio may have been overestimated because the A\u03b21\u201340 levels measured were at the detection limit. This similarity in the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios generated by the different mutants has, to the best of our knowledge, never been observed in previous studies.Highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotypeIn order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions, we purified to homogeneity \u03b3-secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1. The purification process (described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts. Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background, this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively \u03b3-secretase complexes made of human components. As highlighted in Figure 4B, our protocol led to the production of stable, high molecular weight \u03b3-secretase complexes (HMWCs) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native (BN)-PAGE of ~350 kDa, which is consistent with previous reports [26], [27], [37]. The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes (Figure 4B, upper panel), for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 (Figure 4B, lower panels). As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different \u03b3-secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates, it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar (Figure 4B), thus facilitating further comparative analyses. The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes (Figure 4C) confirmed the presence of all core components (NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, Flag-PEN2 and PS1) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1. Interestingly, the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified \u03b3-secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification (Figure 1A), indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations. To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect \u03b3-secretase activity in these purified complexes, we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate (Figure 3A) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes, immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity. As shown in Figure 5A, \u03b3-secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones. This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions (Figure 5A). Next, sandwich ELISAs directed against A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes. Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA, the production of both A\u03b2 species by \u03b3-secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants (Figure 5B). The A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio measured in PS1-WT \u03b3-secretase complexes (~0.22) was similar to that previously reported [26], [27], thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of \u03b3-secretase activity with this protocol. Together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P, \u0394E9, and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss (at least 90% as estimated by ELISA) of \u03b3-secretase activity.thumbnailFigure 4. High-grade purification of human \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) Schematic representation of the \u03b3-secretase purification process. Briefly, Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human \u03b3-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants. Next, these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods. (B) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified \u03b3-secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants. Equal volumes of the different purified \u03b3-secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4\u201316% Bis-Tris gel, and stained with silver nitrate (top panel), or immunostained for NCT (NCT164, middle panel) or PS1-NTF (ab10281, bottom panel) as indicated. \u03b3-Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes (HMWCs) of ~350 kDa. Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones. (C) Equal volumes of purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) and immunostained with anti-NCT (NCT164), anti-PS1-NTF (MAB1563), anti-PS1-CTF (MAB5232), anti-HA (3F10), or anti-Flag (M2) antibodies. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g004 thumbnailFigure 5. Enzymatic activity of highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants.Equal amounts of the different purified \u03b3-secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag, as described in Figure 3. The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody (M2) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag (A), and by sandwich ELISA for A\u03b21\u201340 or A\u03b21\u201342 (B). Note that the levels of A\u03b2 produced from FAD-linked \u03b3-secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards, close to the detection limit. Whenever possible, A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by \u03b3-secretase have been reported. First, it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A\u03b21\u201342 [15], [38]. Since A\u03b21\u201342, the first A\u03b2 specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [16], [39], is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A\u03b2 species [40], [41], [42], it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [43]. This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A\u03b2 accumulation and deposition in the brain [44], [45]. However, Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A\u03b2 production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [23]. These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo. By extension, we hypothesized that the other components of \u03b3-secretase, namely APH1, NCT and PEN2, may influence the mutant phenotype as well. Indeed, \u03b3-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2. Therefore, it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct \u03b3-secretase subtypes. This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A\u03b2 profiles. When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A\u03b2 species [24]. With this regard, it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [23] and employed here (cf. Figure S3). Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems, we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems, by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human \u03b3-secretase components. Under these conditions, the biochemical and functional properties of \u03b3-secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, \u0394E9, and P436Q), dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized. The activity of \u03b3-secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for \u03b3-secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5, APH1aL, Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [26], [27], that resulted in A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3. In contrast, we found a major loss in the activity of \u03b3-secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of \u03b3-secretase [5], [6], [32], the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected. Indeed, the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A\u03b21\u201342 levels both in vivo [46] and in vitro [20], in the presence of endogenous PS1, PS2 and APH1 components. In contrast, Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 production in a PS knockout background. These results are consistent with our in vitro data, although the reduction in A\u03b21\u201342 and A\u03b21\u201340 production was more pronounced in our system. However, they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A\u03b21\u201342 associated with a decrease in A\u03b21\u201340. Taken together, these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of \u03b3-secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations. Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use, in previously described cellular systems, of APP carrying the Swedish mutation (K670M/N671L) [20], [23], [46]. Initially, this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A\u03b2 species by favouring its \u03b2-secretase cleavage [47], [48]. However, Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the \u03b3-secretase cleavage [49]. In particular, these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A\u03b242, associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A\u03b2, compared with the wild-type APP. Therefore, one cannot exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants, as suggested earlier [50].As far as the PS1-\u0394E9 mutant is concerned, previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A\u03b240 levels associated with an increase in A\u03b242 levels [51], [52], or no changes in A\u03b240 levels despite increased A\u03b242 levels [53], or a decrease in both A\u03b2 species [23]. In the present study, A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342, as well as AICD levels generated from purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with PS1-\u0394E9 were close to the limit of detection, resulting in a loss of at least 95% of the \u03b3-secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1. Similarly, we found a near to complete loss of \u03b3-secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant (mean onset: 28.3 years) [54]. Consistent with a recent study [35], and in contrast to PS1-L166P, the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired. Interestingly, the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased \u03b3-secretase activity and A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells (~75% or ~50% of the control for A\u03b240 or A\u03b242, respectively), but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study (more than 97% for both A\u03b2 species).Overall, our data show that, under our experimental conditions, the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity (at least 90%) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified \u03b3-secretase complexes. This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A\u03b21\u201342 levels were relatively less affected than A\u03b21\u201340 levels. Interestingly, the ratio between the two A\u03b2 species was similar for the variants tested here (~1), suggesting a common modulatory mechanism. Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of \u03b3-secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio compared to PS1-WT, as previously observed in vivo [15], [38]. Taken together, the overall reduction in A\u03b2 levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions. Indeed, even if A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions, A\u03b2 production was strikingly different.One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of \u03b3-secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations. For instance, it remains unknown whether \u03b3-secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations. In support to that regard, Winkler and colleagues recently purified human \u03b3-secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes, containing both APH1a and AHP1b, led to increased A\u03b21\u201342 production associated with decreased A\u03b21\u201340 production, as compared to the PS1-WT complexes. Another possible explanation would be that purified \u03b3-secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates, due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins. These include TMP21 or the recently reported \u03b3-secretase activating protein (GSAP) [12], [13]. Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis.The loss of activity in \u03b3-secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD. As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes, including the neprilysin [55], and the lipoprotein receptor, LRP1 [11], it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo. For instance, it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A\u03b2 metabolism in return. In support to these views, Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants, albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [56]. They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone, suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions. These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [57]. Altogether, the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of \u03b3-secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD. They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting \u03b3-secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [58]. Supporting this view, the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, but actually made it worse [59].Collectively, our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A\u03b2 pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A\u03b2 species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by \u03b3-secretase substrates. This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease. Since it has been established that A\u03b2 and AICD are generated following the processing by \u03b3-secretase at two distinct gamma- and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [60], further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP, as well as in other known \u03b3-secretase substrates.Materials and Methods Top DNA Constructs and mutagenesisNCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA, wild-type PS1 human cDNAs (PS1-WT) were obtained from D. Selkoe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). PS1 \u0394E9 cDNA was obtained from C. Saura (Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Spain). PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A cDNAs were obtained from M. Wolfe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). Mutations in PSEN1, namely, L166P and P436Q, were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis on the plasmid pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)-PS1-WT using T7 or BGH primers (specific to the plasmid DNA sequence) together with the corresponding primers: L166P Rv: 5\u2032 CAG CAA CAA Taa gct tGA TAT AAT AGG 3\u2032; L166P Fw: 5\u2032 CTT ATT ATA TCa agc ttA TTG TTG CTG 3\u2032; P436Q Rv: 5\u2032 TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTC TTG AAA ATG GCA AGG AG 3\u2032; P436Q Fw: 5\u2032 TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTG CCA GCT CTT CAA ATC TCC 3\u2032. The sequences corresponding to enzyme restriction sites are given in small letters. The PCR fragments were next digested with BamHI/HindIII and HindIII/XhoI respectively, and were subcloned into pcDNA3. PS1 D257A/D385A (DDAA) was obtained by subcloning the DraI/XhoI digested fragment of PS1 D385A into pcDNA3.1-PS1 D257A. The APP based substrate SPA4CT-Flag, corresponding to the signal peptide of APP fused to the APP-C99-Flag with a small linker region (DA) [36], was obtained by removing the HindIII/EcoRI fragment of pcDNA3-APP695-Flag and inserting the following annealed primers: 5\u2032 AGC TTA TGC TGC CCG GTT TG GCA CTG CTC CTG CTG GCC GCC TGG ACG GCT CGG GCG GAT GCA GAT GCA G 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 AAT TCT GCA TCT GCA TCC GCC CGA GCC GTC CAG GCG GCC AGC AGG AGC AGT GCC AAA CCG GGC AGC ATA 3\u2032. All constructs were next subcloned into the self-inactivated vector pSIN-PGK-WHV cassette (a kind gift from R. Zufferey, Brain Mind Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland). Inserts for plasmids pET21-C100-Flag, and pET21-C100-His were generated by PCR as previously described [27]. Plasmids pMD2G and psPAX2 were obtained from D. Trono (Global Health Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland).Lentivector productionReplication-defective lentiviral particles were produced by a three-plasmid transient transfection of cells from the human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cell line [61]. Briefly, cells were incubated in 10 cm dishes until they reached 70% confluence and were transiently co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method, with 5 \u00b5g of envelope plasmid (pMD2G), 15 \u00b5g of packaging plasmid (psPAX2), and 20 \u00b5g of vector plasmids (pSIN-PGK-WHV). Cells were incubated overnight with DNA-calcium precipitates, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) and incubated with 7 mL of DMEM. After 24 h, the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled, passed through 0.45 \u00b5m filter, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C as 2 mL aliquots until use. A p24 ELISA (Zeptometrix corporation) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated.Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductionsMouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs, obtained from B. De Strooper, Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology, Belgium) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [30], [31] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen). A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors (LV) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage (1/20). Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection. The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins (designated \u03b3 - PS1/2) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants, by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT, PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9, PS1-P436Q, PS1-D257A, PS1-D385A, and PS1-DDAA. For each PS1 variant, five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for \u03b3-secretase purification. For SPA4CT overexpression experiments, 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM, 1% FBS, P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM, 2% FBS, P/S for 24 h. Finally, cell culture medium was harvested, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000\u00d7 rpm and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing. Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction.Protein extractionTotal protein extracts were prepared in 1% NP40 - HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000\u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7 g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).Multi-step purification of human \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1) Cell membrane preparation. MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells (1.0\u00d7109 cells) expressing NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1: wild type (WT), or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues, were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer (50 mM MES, pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Next, cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer (Emulsiflex-C5, Avestin Inc, ON Canada) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000\u00d7 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C in a SW32Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet. 2) Bicarbonate wash. The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 11.3) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times, and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. 3) Solubilisation of \u03b3-secretase complexes. The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times. The membranes were then incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant saved. This lysate is defined as \u201csolubilised \u03b3-secretase preparation\u201d. Next, these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of \u03b3-secretase complexes as described below. 4) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification. The solubilised \u03b3-secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer, and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) (final detergent concentration: 0.08% CHAPSO, 0.08% digitonin) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with agitation after adding 200 \u00b5L of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 \u00b5g/mL of Flag peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated \u201cM2 pooled 800 \u00b5L fractions\u201d. 5) Anti-V5 affinity purification. The M2 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1 mL with 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with 200 \u00b5L of anti-V5 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin-TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted for 1 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 500 \u00b5g/mL of V5 peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated 4 times, and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated \u201cV5 pooled 1.6 mL fractions\u201d. 6) Anti-HA affinity purification. As a final purification step, the V5 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1.8 mL with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with 200 \u00b5L of anti-HA affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted overnight at 4\u00b0C with 0.2 mL of this buffer containing 200 \u00b5g/mL of HA peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once, for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, and the two eluted fractions were kept separately, designated \u201cHA fraction E1\u201d and \u201cHA fraction E2\u201d.Co-immunoprecipitationCo-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts. Briefly, 100 \u00b5g of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche), and 50 \u00b5L of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. Samples were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer. Finally, beads were resuspended in 50 \u00b5L of 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro \u03b3-secretase assays.In vitro \u03b3-secretase activity assaysIn vitro \u03b3-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27]. \u03b3-Secretase APP-based substrates were expressed in E. coli transfected with plasmids pET21-C100-Flag or pET21-C100-His as a fusion protein consisting of a Met for translation initiation, and either the Flag tag sequence (C100-Flag) or the His tag sequence (C100-His), and were affinity purified using an anti-Flag resin (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) or an Ni-NTA agarose resin (Invitrogen), respectively. In vitro assays were performed at 37\u00b0C for 4 h, with 1 \u00b5M of recombinant substrate, 0.025% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and 0.1% phosphatidylcholine (PC). \u03b3-Secretase activity was quantified by measuring the amount of AICD and A\u03b2 generated during the reaction, by immunoblot or sandwich ELISA respectively, as described below.SDS-PAGE, Native PAGE, Western blotting and antibodiesTotal or microsomal protein extracts were resolved by electrophoresis on NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen) or on standard 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide Tris Glycine gels for SDS-PAGE analysis. Purified \u03b3-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE\u2122 Novex\u00ae Bis-Tris 4\u201316% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen). Silver staining was performed directly on gel according to manufacturer instructions (Biorad). For immunoblot analysis, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (Whatman), and probed with the following antibodies: anti-Nicastrin NCT164 (BD Bioscience), anti-V5-tag for NCT-V5 (Covance), MAB1563 (Millipore) or ab10281 (Abcam) for PS1 NTF, MAB5232 for PS1 CTF (Millipore), 3F10 for APH1aL-HA (Roche), anti-Flag M2 for Flag-PEN-2 or C100-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich), A8717 for APP CTF (Sigma-Aldrich), and A2066 for \u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Anti-mouse/rabbit/rat IgG conjugated to Alexa 680 were purchased from Invitrogen. The Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR) was used to detect the fluorescent signal.Quantification of A\u03b2 peptidesA\u03b2 peptides from the \u03b3-secretase assays described above were quantified by sandwich ELISA according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Three kits were used to detect human A\u03b21\u201340 (Invitrogen KHB3481) and A\u03b21\u201342 (Invitrogen KHB3544 and Wako 269-64401).Supporting Information Top Figure S1. Characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing human FAD-linked PS1 variants in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Presenilin double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Two clones per PS1 variant were selected for characterization. (A) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with various antibodies to detect the endogenous \u03b3-secretase core components: NCT (NCT164), hPS1 (NTF, MAB1563), and PEN2 (UD1), and with an antibody for APP (A8717). \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. (B) \u03b3-Secretase activity assays were performed with microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with lipids and 1 \u00b5M of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563).

Fraering*\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Brain Mind Institute, Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Alzheimer's Disease, Lausanne, SwitzerlandAbstract Top BackgroundMutations linked to early onset, familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are found most frequently in PSEN1, the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1). Together with nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the \u03b3-secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides. Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A\u03b2 production by enhancing the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain (AICD). Moreover, controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems, by either increasing A\u03b21\u201342 production, decreasing A\u03b21\u201340 production, or both. Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of \u03b3-secretase, we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT, APH1aL, PEN2, and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P, \u0394E9, or P436Q.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations. A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes. The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of \u03b3-secretase activity phenotype, in terms of A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro.Conclusion/SignificanceOur data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong \u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.Citation: Cacquevel M, Aeschbach L, Houacine J, Fraering PC (2012) Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified \u03b3-Secretase Complexes.

PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2, respectively, that constitute the catalytic core of \u03b3-secretase, the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional, Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases (I-CLiPs) [3]. Active \u03b3-secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin (NCT), the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and the presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2). Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue \u03b3-secretase inhibitors to PS1 [4], as well as the abolishment of \u03b3-secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [4], [5], [6], have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex.PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the \u03b3-secretase complex. The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [7], releasing their corresponding intracellular domains, which are capable of influencing gene expression. For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4, the \u03b3-secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function, whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3\u03b2 [8], the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established (see [9] for a review). The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by the successive actions of \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase, generating amyloid-beta peptides (A\u03b2) of different lengths, ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [10]. Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) by \u03b3-secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression, a major genetic determinant of AD, and in cholesterol metabolism [11]. In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate \u03b3-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].In a pathological context, 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD (www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations). It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A\u03b2 species, mainly A\u03b21\u201342, that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of the disease [15], [16]. Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Despite this growing consensus, the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A\u03b242, A\u03b240, and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations. On one hand, a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A\u03b242 production, accompanied or not with reduced A\u03b240 production, thereby leading to an increased A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio. On the other hand, reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [20]. Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A\u03b2 and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects. For example, endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis, as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A\u03b2 generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [23]. Next, it has been reported that \u03b3-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition (with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms, six combinations of \u03b3-secretase are possible), with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A\u03b2 species generated [24]. In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of \u03b3-secretase in cell-free systems, we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [25], [26], [27]. In particular, protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active \u03b3-secretase constituted of NCT, APH1aL, PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [26], [27] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 \u00c5 and 12 \u00c5 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [28], [29]. However, these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1. Here, we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human \u03b3-secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of \u03b3-secretase activity.Results Top Generation, selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutantsIn order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human \u03b3-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants, we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line that lacks the two presenilins (PS1/2\u2212/\u2212) [30], [31]. Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines, on a PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 background, that overexpress tagged versions of the three human \u03b3-secretase subunits NCT, APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1, and to purify the different human \u03b3-secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps. This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse \u03b3-secretase components. First, a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 (hNCT-V5), human APH1aL-HA (hAPH1aL-HA) and human Flag-PEN2 (Flag-hPEN2) into MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time. Next, the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected (designated \u03b3 - PS1/2) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants: PS1-WT, three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial, catalytic site aspartate residues (D257A, D385A, and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article), and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, \u0394E9 and P436Q, with mean disease onset at 24 years, 45.5 years and 28.3 years, respectively).For each PS1 variant, two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins, and extensively characterized (Figure 1). To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all \u03b3-sectease components from wild-type MEFs, they are collectively designated \u03b3-MEFs. As shown in Figure 1A, the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [23], [32]. As expected, and when compared to the parental \u03b3- PS1/2 cell line, higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones. In contrast to PEN2, APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line. Indeed, and as previously reported [23], [32], PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants, and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1. Interestingly, PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band, possibly reflecting a post-translational modification. Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones. First, and in sharp contrast to the other clones, those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 (PS1-FL; Figure 1A). As estimated by densitometry, the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87\u00b12% and 79\u00b17% of total PS1 (PS1-NTF+PS1-FL), respectively. Next, the PS1-\u0394E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments, as previously described [33], while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments, suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis.thumbnailFigure 1. Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human \u03b3-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5, Flag-hPEN2, hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line, designated as \u03b3- PS1/2, that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits. \u03b3- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Each clone, derived form the \u03b3- PS1/2, was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol \u03b3 and followed by the number of the clone (\u03b3-MEF) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF (WT MEF) and MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Two clones per \u03b3-secretase variant were selected for characterization. (A\u2013B) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 4\u201312% Bis-Tris or 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the \u03b3-secretase core components NCT (NCT164), PS1 (NTF, MAB1563; CTF; MAB5232), APH1aL-HA (3F10), and Flag-PEN2 (M2) (A), and endogenous APP (A8717) (B). \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. CTF: C-terminal fragment, FL: full-length, im.: immature NCT; m.: mature NCT, N: N-glycosylated, NTF: N-terminal fragment, O: O-glycosylated.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP. As expected, and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs (a common characteristic among known substrates in response to \u03b3-secretase pharmacological inhibition), the activity of \u03b3-secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental \u03b3 - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 (Figure 1B). In the clones expressing PS1-WT, APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high \u03b3-secretase activity, while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation. In PS1-\u0394E9 clones, a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed (Figure 1B). Although a poor recovery of \u03b3-secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1-\u0394E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [23], the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [34], [35]. Importantly, all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5, hAPH1aL-HA, Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other \u03b3-secretase components (cf. Figure S1A). These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the \u03b3-secretase.Next, we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A\u03b2 species. For this purpose, and as described elsewhere [36], we used an APP-based \u03b3-secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus (SPA4CT-Flag). This substrate was transduced in the above-described \u03b3-secretase overexpressing stable cell lines (\u03b3-MEFs) as well as in wild-type MEFs, and APP-CTFs and A\u03b2 levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media, respectively (Figure 2). Under these conditions, the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate, associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels (Figure 2A and Figure S2). As estimated by ELISA, a three-fold increase in A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase (\u03b3-MEF WT), in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs (Figure 2B). Also, the average A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were not significantly different in those cell lines (Mean \u00b1 SD: \u03b3-MEF WT#5: 0.30\u00b10.01; \u03b3-MEF WT#8: 0.29\u00b10.01; WT MEF: 0.19\u00b10.06). Next, overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in \u03b3-MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants (Figure 2C), and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A\u03b2 levels as measured by ELISA (Figure 2D). First, only traces of both A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were detected in \u03b3-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants. Next, \u03b3-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A\u03b2 levels when compared to the wild-type clones. Overall, the average A\u03b21\u201340 levels were decreased in these cell lines (Mean of two clones in pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 224.6\u00b10.1, L166P: 84.3\u00b134.2, \u0394E9: 167.2\u00b140.7, P436Q: 82.8\u00b174.7), while the A\u03b21\u201342 levels were increased (Mean of two clones in pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 69.9\u00b17.9, L166P: 310.7\u00b181.0, \u0394E9: 94.4\u00b118.5, P436Q: 141.1\u00b198.5). Consistent with previously reported data, the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were increased in all \u03b3-MEF clones overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations (Figure 2D) (Mean of two clones pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 0.31\u00b10.03, L166P: 3.8\u00b10.58, \u0394E9: 0.6\u00b10.03, P436Q: 2.0\u00b10.59).thumbnailFigure 2. A\u03b2 production in cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.WT MEF, \u03b3-MEF and \u03b3 - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus. Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717) (A, C). A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 levels were also measured in the corresponding cell culture media (B, D). Data corresponds to three independent experiments (Mean \u00b1 SEM).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified \u03b3-secretase complexesWe next assessed the activity of \u03b3-secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of \u03b3-MEFs. Membrane protein extracts were prepared and \u03b3-secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP, and referred to as C100-Flag (Figure 3A). The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry. As shown in Figure 3A, the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1-\u0394E9 clones accounted for 42\u00b11% and 13\u00b16% of that in the PS1-WT clones, respectively. AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants. Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other human \u03b3-secretase components (Figure S1B).thumbnailFigure 3. Enzymatic activity of partially purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) \u03b3-Secretase activity assays performed with \u03b3-MEF and \u03b3 - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with lipids and 1 \u00b5M of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions, reflecting \u03b3-secretase activity, were estimated by densitometry. PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. (B) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4\u00b0C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins, and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in (A). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for \u03b3-secretase subunits ((NCT164 (NCT), MAB1563 (PS1-NTF), or UD1 (PEN2)). AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody (A8717). *Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains. (C) A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL (left Y-axis) or in percentage (right Y-axis) of the mean of A\u03b21\u201340 levels generated by the two wild-type clones. A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios are indicated on the top of the bars. The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions. To do so, \u03b3-secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate. Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins (anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10, targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of \u03b3-secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions. As shown in Figure 3B, the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT, PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the \u03b3-secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used (Figures 3B). In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts (Figure 3A), those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation, when compared to PS1-WT (Figure 3B). Furthermore, levels of A\u03b21\u201340 produced from PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~6%, ~1.5% and ~0.5%, when compared to these produced from PS1-WT \u03b3-secretase. Following the same tendency, A\u03b21\u201342 levels generated from PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9 and PS1-P436Q \u03b3-secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~20%, ~5% and ~3% of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes. The A\u03b21-42/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio measured for WT \u03b3-MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data (compare Figures 2D and 3C), validating our in vitro experimental conditions. Interestingly, an overall A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio of ~1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants, with the exception of P436Q#4 (~2). However, in the latter, the ratio may have been overestimated because the A\u03b21\u201340 levels measured were at the detection limit. This similarity in the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios generated by the different mutants has, to the best of our knowledge, never been observed in previous studies.Highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotypeIn order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions, we purified to homogeneity \u03b3-secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1. The purification process (described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts. Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background, this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively \u03b3-secretase complexes made of human components. As highlighted in Figure 4B, our protocol led to the production of stable, high molecular weight \u03b3-secretase complexes (HMWCs) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native (BN)-PAGE of ~350 kDa, which is consistent with previous reports [26], [27], [37]. The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes (Figure 4B, upper panel), for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 (Figure 4B, lower panels). As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different \u03b3-secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates, it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar (Figure 4B), thus facilitating further comparative analyses. The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes (Figure 4C) confirmed the presence of all core components (NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, Flag-PEN2 and PS1) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1. Interestingly, the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified \u03b3-secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification (Figure 1A), indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations. To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect \u03b3-secretase activity in these purified complexes, we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate (Figure 3A) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes, immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity. As shown in Figure 5A, \u03b3-secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones. This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions (Figure 5A). Next, sandwich ELISAs directed against A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes. Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA, the production of both A\u03b2 species by \u03b3-secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants (Figure 5B). The A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio measured in PS1-WT \u03b3-secretase complexes (~0.22) was similar to that previously reported [26], [27], thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of \u03b3-secretase activity with this protocol. Together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P, \u0394E9, and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss (at least 90% as estimated by ELISA) of \u03b3-secretase activity.thumbnailFigure 4. High-grade purification of human \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) Schematic representation of the \u03b3-secretase purification process. Briefly, Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human \u03b3-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants. Next, these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods. (B) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified \u03b3-secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants. Equal volumes of the different purified \u03b3-secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4\u201316% Bis-Tris gel, and stained with silver nitrate (top panel), or immunostained for NCT (NCT164, middle panel) or PS1-NTF (ab10281, bottom panel) as indicated. \u03b3-Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes (HMWCs) of ~350 kDa. Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones. (C) Equal volumes of purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) and immunostained with anti-NCT (NCT164), anti-PS1-NTF (MAB1563), anti-PS1-CTF (MAB5232), anti-HA (3F10), or anti-Flag (M2) antibodies. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g004 thumbnailFigure 5. Enzymatic activity of highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants.Equal amounts of the different purified \u03b3-secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag, as described in Figure 3. The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody (M2) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag (A), and by sandwich ELISA for A\u03b21\u201340 or A\u03b21\u201342 (B). Note that the levels of A\u03b2 produced from FAD-linked \u03b3-secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards, close to the detection limit. Whenever possible, A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by \u03b3-secretase have been reported. First, it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A\u03b21\u201342 [15], [38]. Since A\u03b21\u201342, the first A\u03b2 specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [16], [39], is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A\u03b2 species [40], [41], [42], it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [43]. This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A\u03b2 accumulation and deposition in the brain [44], [45]. However, Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A\u03b2 production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [23]. These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo. By extension, we hypothesized that the other components of \u03b3-secretase, namely APH1, NCT and PEN2, may influence the mutant phenotype as well. Indeed, \u03b3-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2. Therefore, it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct \u03b3-secretase subtypes. This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A\u03b2 profiles. When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A\u03b2 species [24]. With this regard, it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [23] and employed here (cf. Figure S3). Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems, we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems, by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human \u03b3-secretase components. Under these conditions, the biochemical and functional properties of \u03b3-secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, \u0394E9, and P436Q), dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized. The activity of \u03b3-secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for \u03b3-secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5, APH1aL, Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [26], [27], that resulted in A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3. In contrast, we found a major loss in the activity of \u03b3-secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of \u03b3-secretase [5], [6], [32], the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected. Indeed, the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A\u03b21\u201342 levels both in vivo [46] and in vitro [20], in the presence of endogenous PS1, PS2 and APH1 components. In contrast, Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 production in a PS knockout background. These results are consistent with our in vitro data, although the reduction in A\u03b21\u201342 and A\u03b21\u201340 production was more pronounced in our system. However, they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A\u03b21\u201342 associated with a decrease in A\u03b21\u201340. Taken together, these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of \u03b3-secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations. Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use, in previously described cellular systems, of APP carrying the Swedish mutation (K670M/N671L) [20], [23], [46]. Initially, this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A\u03b2 species by favouring its \u03b2-secretase cleavage [47], [48]. However, Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the \u03b3-secretase cleavage [49]. In particular, these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A\u03b242, associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A\u03b2, compared with the wild-type APP. Therefore, one cannot exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants, as suggested earlier [50].As far as the PS1-\u0394E9 mutant is concerned, previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A\u03b240 levels associated with an increase in A\u03b242 levels [51], [52], or no changes in A\u03b240 levels despite increased A\u03b242 levels [53], or a decrease in both A\u03b2 species [23]. In the present study, A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342, as well as AICD levels generated from purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with PS1-\u0394E9 were close to the limit of detection, resulting in a loss of at least 95% of the \u03b3-secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1. Similarly, we found a near to complete loss of \u03b3-secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant (mean onset: 28.3 years) [54]. Consistent with a recent study [35], and in contrast to PS1-L166P, the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired. Interestingly, the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased \u03b3-secretase activity and A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells (~75% or ~50% of the control for A\u03b240 or A\u03b242, respectively), but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study (more than 97% for both A\u03b2 species).Overall, our data show that, under our experimental conditions, the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity (at least 90%) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified \u03b3-secretase complexes. This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A\u03b21\u201342 levels were relatively less affected than A\u03b21\u201340 levels. Interestingly, the ratio between the two A\u03b2 species was similar for the variants tested here (~1), suggesting a common modulatory mechanism. Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of \u03b3-secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio compared to PS1-WT, as previously observed in vivo [15], [38]. Taken together, the overall reduction in A\u03b2 levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions. Indeed, even if A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions, A\u03b2 production was strikingly different.One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of \u03b3-secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations. For instance, it remains unknown whether \u03b3-secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations. In support to that regard, Winkler and colleagues recently purified human \u03b3-secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes, containing both APH1a and AHP1b, led to increased A\u03b21\u201342 production associated with decreased A\u03b21\u201340 production, as compared to the PS1-WT complexes. Another possible explanation would be that purified \u03b3-secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates, due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins. These include TMP21 or the recently reported \u03b3-secretase activating protein (GSAP) [12], [13]. Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis.The loss of activity in \u03b3-secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD. As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes, including the neprilysin [55], and the lipoprotein receptor, LRP1 [11], it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo. For instance, it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A\u03b2 metabolism in return. In support to these views, Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants, albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [56]. They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone, suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions. These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [57]. Altogether, the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of \u03b3-secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD. They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting \u03b3-secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [58]. Supporting this view, the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, but actually made it worse [59].Collectively, our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A\u03b2 pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A\u03b2 species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by \u03b3-secretase substrates. This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease. Since it has been established that A\u03b2 and AICD are generated following the processing by \u03b3-secretase at two distinct gamma- and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [60], further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP, as well as in other known \u03b3-secretase substrates.Materials and Methods Top DNA Constructs and mutagenesisNCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA, wild-type PS1 human cDNAs (PS1-WT) were obtained from D. Selkoe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). PS1 \u0394E9 cDNA was obtained from C. Saura (Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Spain). PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A cDNAs were obtained from M. Wolfe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). Mutations in PSEN1, namely, L166P and P436Q, were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis on the plasmid pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)-PS1-WT using T7 or BGH primers (specific to the plasmid DNA sequence) together with the corresponding primers: L166P Rv: 5\u2032 CAG CAA CAA Taa gct tGA TAT AAT AGG 3\u2032; L166P Fw: 5\u2032 CTT ATT ATA TCa agc ttA TTG TTG CTG 3\u2032; P436Q Rv: 5\u2032 TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTC TTG AAA ATG GCA AGG AG 3\u2032; P436Q Fw: 5\u2032 TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTG CCA GCT CTT CAA ATC TCC 3\u2032. The sequences corresponding to enzyme restriction sites are given in small letters. The PCR fragments were next digested with BamHI/HindIII and HindIII/XhoI respectively, and were subcloned into pcDNA3. PS1 D257A/D385A (DDAA) was obtained by subcloning the DraI/XhoI digested fragment of PS1 D385A into pcDNA3.1-PS1 D257A. The APP based substrate SPA4CT-Flag, corresponding to the signal peptide of APP fused to the APP-C99-Flag with a small linker region (DA) [36], was obtained by removing the HindIII/EcoRI fragment of pcDNA3-APP695-Flag and inserting the following annealed primers: 5\u2032 AGC TTA TGC TGC CCG GTT TG GCA CTG CTC CTG CTG GCC GCC TGG ACG GCT CGG GCG GAT GCA GAT GCA G 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 AAT TCT GCA TCT GCA TCC GCC CGA GCC GTC CAG GCG GCC AGC AGG AGC AGT GCC AAA CCG GGC AGC ATA 3\u2032. All constructs were next subcloned into the self-inactivated vector pSIN-PGK-WHV cassette (a kind gift from R. Zufferey, Brain Mind Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland). Inserts for plasmids pET21-C100-Flag, and pET21-C100-His were generated by PCR as previously described [27]. Plasmids pMD2G and psPAX2 were obtained from D. Trono (Global Health Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland).Lentivector productionReplication-defective lentiviral particles were produced by a three-plasmid transient transfection of cells from the human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cell line [61]. Briefly, cells were incubated in 10 cm dishes until they reached 70% confluence and were transiently co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method, with 5 \u00b5g of envelope plasmid (pMD2G), 15 \u00b5g of packaging plasmid (psPAX2), and 20 \u00b5g of vector plasmids (pSIN-PGK-WHV). Cells were incubated overnight with DNA-calcium precipitates, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) and incubated with 7 mL of DMEM. After 24 h, the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled, passed through 0.45 \u00b5m filter, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C as 2 mL aliquots until use. A p24 ELISA (Zeptometrix corporation) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated.Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductionsMouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs, obtained from B. De Strooper, Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology, Belgium) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [30], [31] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen). A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors (LV) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage (1/20). Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection. The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins (designated \u03b3 - PS1/2) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants, by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT, PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9, PS1-P436Q, PS1-D257A, PS1-D385A, and PS1-DDAA. For each PS1 variant, five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for \u03b3-secretase purification. For SPA4CT overexpression experiments, 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM, 1% FBS, P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM, 2% FBS, P/S for 24 h. Finally, cell culture medium was harvested, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000\u00d7 rpm and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing. Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction.Protein extractionTotal protein extracts were prepared in 1% NP40 - HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000\u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7 g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).Multi-step purification of human \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1) Cell membrane preparation. MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells (1.0\u00d7109 cells) expressing NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1: wild type (WT), or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues, were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer (50 mM MES, pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Next, cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer (Emulsiflex-C5, Avestin Inc, ON Canada) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000\u00d7 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C in a SW32Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet. 2) Bicarbonate wash. The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 11.3) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times, and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. 3) Solubilisation of \u03b3-secretase complexes. The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times. The membranes were then incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant saved. This lysate is defined as \u201csolubilised \u03b3-secretase preparation\u201d. Next, these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of \u03b3-secretase complexes as described below. 4) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification. The solubilised \u03b3-secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer, and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) (final detergent concentration: 0.08% CHAPSO, 0.08% digitonin) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with agitation after adding 200 \u00b5L of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 \u00b5g/mL of Flag peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated \u201cM2 pooled 800 \u00b5L fractions\u201d. 5) Anti-V5 affinity purification. The M2 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1 mL with 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with 200 \u00b5L of anti-V5 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin-TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted for 1 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 500 \u00b5g/mL of V5 peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated 4 times, and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated \u201cV5 pooled 1.6 mL fractions\u201d. 6) Anti-HA affinity purification. As a final purification step, the V5 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1.8 mL with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with 200 \u00b5L of anti-HA affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted overnight at 4\u00b0C with 0.2 mL of this buffer containing 200 \u00b5g/mL of HA peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once, for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, and the two eluted fractions were kept separately, designated \u201cHA fraction E1\u201d and \u201cHA fraction E2\u201d.Co-immunoprecipitationCo-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts. Briefly, 100 \u00b5g of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche), and 50 \u00b5L of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. Samples were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer. Finally, beads were resuspended in 50 \u00b5L of 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro \u03b3-secretase assays.In vitro \u03b3-secretase activity assaysIn vitro \u03b3-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27]. \u03b3-Secretase APP-based substrates were expressed in E. coli transfected with plasmids pET21-C100-Flag or pET21-C100-His as a fusion protein consisting of a Met for translation initiation, and either the Flag tag sequence (C100-Flag) or the His tag sequence (C100-His), and were affinity purified using an anti-Flag resin (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) or an Ni-NTA agarose resin (Invitrogen), respectively. In vitro assays were performed at 37\u00b0C for 4 h, with 1 \u00b5M of recombinant substrate, 0.025% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and 0.1% phosphatidylcholine (PC). \u03b3-Secretase activity was quantified by measuring the amount of AICD and A\u03b2 generated during the reaction, by immunoblot or sandwich ELISA respectively, as described below.SDS-PAGE, Native PAGE, Western blotting and antibodiesTotal or microsomal protein extracts were resolved by electrophoresis on NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen) or on standard 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide Tris Glycine gels for SDS-PAGE analysis. Purified \u03b3-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE\u2122 Novex\u00ae Bis-Tris 4\u201316% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen). Silver staining was performed directly on gel according to manufacturer instructions (Biorad). For immunoblot analysis, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (Whatman), and probed with the following antibodies: anti-Nicastrin NCT164 (BD Bioscience), anti-V5-tag for NCT-V5 (Covance), MAB1563 (Millipore) or ab10281 (Abcam) for PS1 NTF, MAB5232 for PS1 CTF (Millipore), 3F10 for APH1aL-HA (Roche), anti-Flag M2 for Flag-PEN-2 or C100-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich), A8717 for APP CTF (Sigma-Aldrich), and A2066 for \u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Anti-mouse/rabbit/rat IgG conjugated to Alexa 680 were purchased from Invitrogen. The Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR) was used to detect the fluorescent signal.Quantification of A\u03b2 peptidesA\u03b2 peptides from the \u03b3-secretase assays described above were quantified by sandwich ELISA according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Three kits were used to detect human A\u03b21\u201340 (Invitrogen KHB3481) and A\u03b21\u201342 (Invitrogen KHB3544 and Wako 269-64401).Supporting Information Top Figure S1. Characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing human FAD-linked PS1 variants in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Presenilin double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Two clones per PS1 variant were selected for characterization. (A) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with various antibodies to detect the endogenous \u03b3-secretase core components: NCT (NCT164), hPS1 (NTF, MAB1563), and PEN2 (UD1), and with an antibody for APP (A8717). \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. (B) \u03b3-Secretase activity assays were performed with microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with lipids and 1 \u00b5M of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. * Indicates a non-specific band, which was not detected in microsomal protein extracts of the same cell lines using the same antibody (MAB1563) (B).

APP-CTF profiles in WT MEF, MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 and \u03b3 - PS1/2 transduced with the SPA4CT construct. WT MEF, MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 and \u03b3 - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]). Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717).(TIF)Figure S3. APH1 isoforms expressed in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Total RNAs were extracted from presenilin double-knockout MEFs, using standard procedures (Qiagen RNAeasy kit) and were quantified by spectrophotometry. One microgram of total RNAs was reverse transcribed for 1 h at 42\u00b0C by using the ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega) and oligo-dT primer in a final volume of 20 \u00b5L. PCR was next performed for each APH1 isoform on 1 \u00b5L of RT reaction by using the Roche PCR kit under standard conditions and the primers described in Table S1. The following cycling conditions were applied for all reactions: 94\u00b0C, 3 min; 30 cycles of [94\u00b0C, 30 s; 58\u00b0C, 30 s; 70\u00b0C, 40 s]; 70\u00b0C, 10 min. PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized using Alpha Innotech UV imager.(TIF)Table S1. Primers used to detect APH1 isoforms in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212.

Fraering*\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Brain Mind Institute, Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Alzheimer's Disease, Lausanne, SwitzerlandAbstract Top BackgroundMutations linked to early onset, familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are found most frequently in PSEN1, the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1). Together with nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the \u03b3-secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides. Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A\u03b2 production by enhancing the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain (AICD). Moreover, controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems, by either increasing A\u03b21\u201342 production, decreasing A\u03b21\u201340 production, or both. Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of \u03b3-secretase, we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT, APH1aL, PEN2, and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P, \u0394E9, or P436Q.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations. A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes. The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of \u03b3-secretase activity phenotype, in terms of A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro.Conclusion/SignificanceOur data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong \u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.Citation: Cacquevel M, Aeschbach L, Houacine J, Fraering PC (2012) Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified \u03b3-Secretase Complexes.

PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2, respectively, that constitute the catalytic core of \u03b3-secretase, the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional, Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases (I-CLiPs) [3]. Active \u03b3-secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin (NCT), the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and the presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2). Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue \u03b3-secretase inhibitors to PS1 [4], as well as the abolishment of \u03b3-secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [4], [5], [6], have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex.PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the \u03b3-secretase complex. The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [7], releasing their corresponding intracellular domains, which are capable of influencing gene expression. For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4, the \u03b3-secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function, whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3\u03b2 [8], the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established (see [9] for a review). The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by the successive actions of \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase, generating amyloid-beta peptides (A\u03b2) of different lengths, ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [10]. Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) by \u03b3-secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression, a major genetic determinant of AD, and in cholesterol metabolism [11]. In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate \u03b3-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].In a pathological context, 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD (www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations). It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A\u03b2 species, mainly A\u03b21\u201342, that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of the disease [15], [16]. Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Despite this growing consensus, the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A\u03b242, A\u03b240, and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations. On one hand, a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A\u03b242 production, accompanied or not with reduced A\u03b240 production, thereby leading to an increased A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio. On the other hand, reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [20]. Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A\u03b2 and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects. For example, endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis, as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A\u03b2 generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [23]. Next, it has been reported that \u03b3-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition (with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms, six combinations of \u03b3-secretase are possible), with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A\u03b2 species generated [24]. In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of \u03b3-secretase in cell-free systems, we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [25], [26], [27]. In particular, protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active \u03b3-secretase constituted of NCT, APH1aL, PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [26], [27] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 \u00c5 and 12 \u00c5 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [28], [29]. However, these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1. Here, we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human \u03b3-secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of \u03b3-secretase activity.Results Top Generation, selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutantsIn order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human \u03b3-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants, we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line that lacks the two presenilins (PS1/2\u2212/\u2212) [30], [31]. Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines, on a PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 background, that overexpress tagged versions of the three human \u03b3-secretase subunits NCT, APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1, and to purify the different human \u03b3-secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps. This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse \u03b3-secretase components. First, a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 (hNCT-V5), human APH1aL-HA (hAPH1aL-HA) and human Flag-PEN2 (Flag-hPEN2) into MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time. Next, the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected (designated \u03b3 - PS1/2) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants: PS1-WT, three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial, catalytic site aspartate residues (D257A, D385A, and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article), and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, \u0394E9 and P436Q, with mean disease onset at 24 years, 45.5 years and 28.3 years, respectively).For each PS1 variant, two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins, and extensively characterized (Figure 1). To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all \u03b3-sectease components from wild-type MEFs, they are collectively designated \u03b3-MEFs. As shown in Figure 1A, the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [23], [32]. As expected, and when compared to the parental \u03b3- PS1/2 cell line, higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones. In contrast to PEN2, APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line. Indeed, and as previously reported [23], [32], PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants, and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1. Interestingly, PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band, possibly reflecting a post-translational modification. Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones. First, and in sharp contrast to the other clones, those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 (PS1-FL; Figure 1A). As estimated by densitometry, the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87\u00b12% and 79\u00b17% of total PS1 (PS1-NTF+PS1-FL), respectively. Next, the PS1-\u0394E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments, as previously described [33], while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments, suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis.thumbnailFigure 1. Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human \u03b3-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5, Flag-hPEN2, hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line, designated as \u03b3- PS1/2, that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits. \u03b3- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Each clone, derived form the \u03b3- PS1/2, was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol \u03b3 and followed by the number of the clone (\u03b3-MEF) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF (WT MEF) and MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Two clones per \u03b3-secretase variant were selected for characterization. (A\u2013B) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 4\u201312% Bis-Tris or 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the \u03b3-secretase core components NCT (NCT164), PS1 (NTF, MAB1563; CTF; MAB5232), APH1aL-HA (3F10), and Flag-PEN2 (M2) (A), and endogenous APP (A8717) (B). \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. CTF: C-terminal fragment, FL: full-length, im.: immature NCT; m.: mature NCT, N: N-glycosylated, NTF: N-terminal fragment, O: O-glycosylated.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP. As expected, and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs (a common characteristic among known substrates in response to \u03b3-secretase pharmacological inhibition), the activity of \u03b3-secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental \u03b3 - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 (Figure 1B). In the clones expressing PS1-WT, APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high \u03b3-secretase activity, while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation. In PS1-\u0394E9 clones, a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed (Figure 1B). Although a poor recovery of \u03b3-secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1-\u0394E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [23], the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [34], [35]. Importantly, all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5, hAPH1aL-HA, Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other \u03b3-secretase components (cf. Figure S1A). These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the \u03b3-secretase.Next, we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A\u03b2 species. For this purpose, and as described elsewhere [36], we used an APP-based \u03b3-secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus (SPA4CT-Flag). This substrate was transduced in the above-described \u03b3-secretase overexpressing stable cell lines (\u03b3-MEFs) as well as in wild-type MEFs, and APP-CTFs and A\u03b2 levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media, respectively (Figure 2). Under these conditions, the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate, associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels (Figure 2A and Figure S2). As estimated by ELISA, a three-fold increase in A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase (\u03b3-MEF WT), in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs (Figure 2B). Also, the average A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were not significantly different in those cell lines (Mean \u00b1 SD: \u03b3-MEF WT#5: 0.30\u00b10.01; \u03b3-MEF WT#8: 0.29\u00b10.01; WT MEF: 0.19\u00b10.06). Next, overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in \u03b3-MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants (Figure 2C), and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A\u03b2 levels as measured by ELISA (Figure 2D). First, only traces of both A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were detected in \u03b3-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants. Next, \u03b3-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A\u03b2 levels when compared to the wild-type clones. Overall, the average A\u03b21\u201340 levels were decreased in these cell lines (Mean of two clones in pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 224.6\u00b10.1, L166P: 84.3\u00b134.2, \u0394E9: 167.2\u00b140.7, P436Q: 82.8\u00b174.7), while the A\u03b21\u201342 levels were increased (Mean of two clones in pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 69.9\u00b17.9, L166P: 310.7\u00b181.0, \u0394E9: 94.4\u00b118.5, P436Q: 141.1\u00b198.5). Consistent with previously reported data, the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were increased in all \u03b3-MEF clones overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations (Figure 2D) (Mean of two clones pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 0.31\u00b10.03, L166P: 3.8\u00b10.58, \u0394E9: 0.6\u00b10.03, P436Q: 2.0\u00b10.59).thumbnailFigure 2. A\u03b2 production in cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.WT MEF, \u03b3-MEF and \u03b3 - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus. Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717) (A, C). A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 levels were also measured in the corresponding cell culture media (B, D). Data corresponds to three independent experiments (Mean \u00b1 SEM).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified \u03b3-secretase complexesWe next assessed the activity of \u03b3-secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of \u03b3-MEFs. Membrane protein extracts were prepared and \u03b3-secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP, and referred to as C100-Flag (Figure 3A). The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry. As shown in Figure 3A, the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1-\u0394E9 clones accounted for 42\u00b11% and 13\u00b16% of that in the PS1-WT clones, respectively. AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants. Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other human \u03b3-secretase components (Figure S1B).thumbnailFigure 3. Enzymatic activity of partially purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) \u03b3-Secretase activity assays performed with \u03b3-MEF and \u03b3 - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with lipids and 1 \u00b5M of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions, reflecting \u03b3-secretase activity, were estimated by densitometry. PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. (B) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4\u00b0C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins, and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in (A). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for \u03b3-secretase subunits ((NCT164 (NCT), MAB1563 (PS1-NTF), or UD1 (PEN2)). AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody (A8717). *Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains. (C) A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL (left Y-axis) or in percentage (right Y-axis) of the mean of A\u03b21\u201340 levels generated by the two wild-type clones. A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios are indicated on the top of the bars. The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions. To do so, \u03b3-secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate. Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins (anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10, targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of \u03b3-secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions. As shown in Figure 3B, the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT, PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the \u03b3-secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used (Figures 3B). In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts (Figure 3A), those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation, when compared to PS1-WT (Figure 3B). Furthermore, levels of A\u03b21\u201340 produced from PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~6%, ~1.5% and ~0.5%, when compared to these produced from PS1-WT \u03b3-secretase. Following the same tendency, A\u03b21\u201342 levels generated from PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9 and PS1-P436Q \u03b3-secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~20%, ~5% and ~3% of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes. The A\u03b21-42/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio measured for WT \u03b3-MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data (compare Figures 2D and 3C), validating our in vitro experimental conditions. Interestingly, an overall A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio of ~1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants, with the exception of P436Q#4 (~2). However, in the latter, the ratio may have been overestimated because the A\u03b21\u201340 levels measured were at the detection limit. This similarity in the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios generated by the different mutants has, to the best of our knowledge, never been observed in previous studies.Highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotypeIn order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions, we purified to homogeneity \u03b3-secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1. The purification process (described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts. Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background, this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively \u03b3-secretase complexes made of human components. As highlighted in Figure 4B, our protocol led to the production of stable, high molecular weight \u03b3-secretase complexes (HMWCs) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native (BN)-PAGE of ~350 kDa, which is consistent with previous reports [26], [27], [37]. The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes (Figure 4B, upper panel), for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 (Figure 4B, lower panels). As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different \u03b3-secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates, it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar (Figure 4B), thus facilitating further comparative analyses. The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes (Figure 4C) confirmed the presence of all core components (NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, Flag-PEN2 and PS1) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1. Interestingly, the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified \u03b3-secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification (Figure 1A), indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations. To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect \u03b3-secretase activity in these purified complexes, we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate (Figure 3A) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes, immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity. As shown in Figure 5A, \u03b3-secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones. This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions (Figure 5A). Next, sandwich ELISAs directed against A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes. Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA, the production of both A\u03b2 species by \u03b3-secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants (Figure 5B). The A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio measured in PS1-WT \u03b3-secretase complexes (~0.22) was similar to that previously reported [26], [27], thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of \u03b3-secretase activity with this protocol. Together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P, \u0394E9, and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss (at least 90% as estimated by ELISA) of \u03b3-secretase activity.thumbnailFigure 4. High-grade purification of human \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) Schematic representation of the \u03b3-secretase purification process. Briefly, Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human \u03b3-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants. Next, these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods. (B) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified \u03b3-secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants. Equal volumes of the different purified \u03b3-secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4\u201316% Bis-Tris gel, and stained with silver nitrate (top panel), or immunostained for NCT (NCT164, middle panel) or PS1-NTF (ab10281, bottom panel) as indicated. \u03b3-Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes (HMWCs) of ~350 kDa. Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones. (C) Equal volumes of purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) and immunostained with anti-NCT (NCT164), anti-PS1-NTF (MAB1563), anti-PS1-CTF (MAB5232), anti-HA (3F10), or anti-Flag (M2) antibodies. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g004 thumbnailFigure 5. Enzymatic activity of highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants.Equal amounts of the different purified \u03b3-secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag, as described in Figure 3. The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody (M2) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag (A), and by sandwich ELISA for A\u03b21\u201340 or A\u03b21\u201342 (B). Note that the levels of A\u03b2 produced from FAD-linked \u03b3-secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards, close to the detection limit. Whenever possible, A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by \u03b3-secretase have been reported. First, it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A\u03b21\u201342 [15], [38]. Since A\u03b21\u201342, the first A\u03b2 specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [16], [39], is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A\u03b2 species [40], [41], [42], it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [43]. This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A\u03b2 accumulation and deposition in the brain [44], [45]. However, Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A\u03b2 production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [23]. These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo. By extension, we hypothesized that the other components of \u03b3-secretase, namely APH1, NCT and PEN2, may influence the mutant phenotype as well. Indeed, \u03b3-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2. Therefore, it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct \u03b3-secretase subtypes. This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A\u03b2 profiles. When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A\u03b2 species [24]. With this regard, it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [23] and employed here (cf. Figure S3). Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems, we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems, by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human \u03b3-secretase components. Under these conditions, the biochemical and functional properties of \u03b3-secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, \u0394E9, and P436Q), dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized. The activity of \u03b3-secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for \u03b3-secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5, APH1aL, Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [26], [27], that resulted in A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3. In contrast, we found a major loss in the activity of \u03b3-secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of \u03b3-secretase [5], [6], [32], the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected. Indeed, the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A\u03b21\u201342 levels both in vivo [46] and in vitro [20], in the presence of endogenous PS1, PS2 and APH1 components. In contrast, Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 production in a PS knockout background. These results are consistent with our in vitro data, although the reduction in A\u03b21\u201342 and A\u03b21\u201340 production was more pronounced in our system. However, they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A\u03b21\u201342 associated with a decrease in A\u03b21\u201340. Taken together, these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of \u03b3-secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations. Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use, in previously described cellular systems, of APP carrying the Swedish mutation (K670M/N671L) [20], [23], [46]. Initially, this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A\u03b2 species by favouring its \u03b2-secretase cleavage [47], [48]. However, Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the \u03b3-secretase cleavage [49]. In particular, these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A\u03b242, associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A\u03b2, compared with the wild-type APP. Therefore, one cannot exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants, as suggested earlier [50].As far as the PS1-\u0394E9 mutant is concerned, previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A\u03b240 levels associated with an increase in A\u03b242 levels [51], [52], or no changes in A\u03b240 levels despite increased A\u03b242 levels [53], or a decrease in both A\u03b2 species [23]. In the present study, A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342, as well as AICD levels generated from purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with PS1-\u0394E9 were close to the limit of detection, resulting in a loss of at least 95% of the \u03b3-secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1. Similarly, we found a near to complete loss of \u03b3-secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant (mean onset: 28.3 years) [54]. Consistent with a recent study [35], and in contrast to PS1-L166P, the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired. Interestingly, the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased \u03b3-secretase activity and A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells (~75% or ~50% of the control for A\u03b240 or A\u03b242, respectively), but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study (more than 97% for both A\u03b2 species).Overall, our data show that, under our experimental conditions, the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity (at least 90%) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified \u03b3-secretase complexes. This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A\u03b21\u201342 levels were relatively less affected than A\u03b21\u201340 levels. Interestingly, the ratio between the two A\u03b2 species was similar for the variants tested here (~1), suggesting a common modulatory mechanism. Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of \u03b3-secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio compared to PS1-WT, as previously observed in vivo [15], [38]. Taken together, the overall reduction in A\u03b2 levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions. Indeed, even if A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions, A\u03b2 production was strikingly different.One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of \u03b3-secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations. For instance, it remains unknown whether \u03b3-secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations. In support to that regard, Winkler and colleagues recently purified human \u03b3-secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes, containing both APH1a and AHP1b, led to increased A\u03b21\u201342 production associated with decreased A\u03b21\u201340 production, as compared to the PS1-WT complexes. Another possible explanation would be that purified \u03b3-secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates, due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins. These include TMP21 or the recently reported \u03b3-secretase activating protein (GSAP) [12], [13]. Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis.The loss of activity in \u03b3-secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD. As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes, including the neprilysin [55], and the lipoprotein receptor, LRP1 [11], it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo. For instance, it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A\u03b2 metabolism in return. In support to these views, Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants, albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [56]. They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone, suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions. These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [57]. Altogether, the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of \u03b3-secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD. They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting \u03b3-secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [58]. Supporting this view, the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, but actually made it worse [59].Collectively, our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A\u03b2 pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A\u03b2 species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by \u03b3-secretase substrates. This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease. Since it has been established that A\u03b2 and AICD are generated following the processing by \u03b3-secretase at two distinct gamma- and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [60], further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP, as well as in other known \u03b3-secretase substrates.Materials and Methods Top DNA Constructs and mutagenesisNCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA, wild-type PS1 human cDNAs (PS1-WT) were obtained from D.

Briefly, cells were incubated in 10 cm dishes until they reached 70% confluence and were transiently co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method, with 5 \u00b5g of envelope plasmid (pMD2G), 15 \u00b5g of packaging plasmid (psPAX2), and 20 \u00b5g of vector plasmids (pSIN-PGK-WHV). Cells were incubated overnight with DNA-calcium precipitates, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) and incubated with 7 mL of DMEM. After 24 h, the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled, passed through 0.45 \u00b5m filter, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C as 2 mL aliquots until use. A p24 ELISA (Zeptometrix corporation) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated.Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductionsMouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs, obtained from B. De Strooper, Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology, Belgium) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [30], [31] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen). A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors (LV) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage (1/20). Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection. The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins (designated \u03b3 - PS1/2) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants, by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT, PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9, PS1-P436Q, PS1-D257A, PS1-D385A, and PS1-DDAA. For each PS1 variant, five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for \u03b3-secretase purification. For SPA4CT overexpression experiments, 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM, 1% FBS, P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM, 2% FBS, P/S for 24 h. Finally, cell culture medium was harvested, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000\u00d7 rpm and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing. Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction.Protein extractionTotal protein extracts were prepared in 1% NP40 - HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000\u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7 g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).Multi-step purification of human \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1) Cell membrane preparation. MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells (1.0\u00d7109 cells) expressing NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1: wild type (WT), or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues, were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer (50 mM MES, pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Next, cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer (Emulsiflex-C5, Avestin Inc, ON Canada) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000\u00d7 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C in a SW32Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet. 2) Bicarbonate wash. The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 11.3) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times, and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. 3) Solubilisation of \u03b3-secretase complexes. The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times. The membranes were then incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant saved. This lysate is defined as \u201csolubilised \u03b3-secretase preparation\u201d. Next, these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of \u03b3-secretase complexes as described below. 4) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification. The solubilised \u03b3-secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer, and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) (final detergent concentration: 0.08% CHAPSO, 0.08% digitonin) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with agitation after adding 200 \u00b5L of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 \u00b5g/mL of Flag peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated \u201cM2 pooled 800 \u00b5L fractions\u201d. 5) Anti-V5 affinity purification. The M2 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1 mL with 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with 200 \u00b5L of anti-V5 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin-TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted for 1 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 500 \u00b5g/mL of V5 peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated 4 times, and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated \u201cV5 pooled 1.6 mL fractions\u201d. 6) Anti-HA affinity purification. As a final purification step, the V5 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1.8 mL with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with 200 \u00b5L of anti-HA affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted overnight at 4\u00b0C with 0.2 mL of this buffer containing 200 \u00b5g/mL of HA peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once, for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, and the two eluted fractions were kept separately, designated \u201cHA fraction E1\u201d and \u201cHA fraction E2\u201d.Co-immunoprecipitationCo-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts. Briefly, 100 \u00b5g of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche), and 50 \u00b5L of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. Samples were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer. Finally, beads were resuspended in 50 \u00b5L of 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro \u03b3-secretase assays.In vitro \u03b3-secretase activity assaysIn vitro \u03b3-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27]. \u03b3-Secretase APP-based substrates were expressed in E. coli transfected with plasmids pET21-C100-Flag or pET21-C100-His as a fusion protein consisting of a Met for translation initiation, and either the Flag tag sequence (C100-Flag) or the His tag sequence (C100-His), and were affinity purified using an anti-Flag resin (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) or an Ni-NTA agarose resin (Invitrogen), respectively. In vitro assays were performed at 37\u00b0C for 4 h, with 1 \u00b5M of recombinant substrate, 0.025% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and 0.1% phosphatidylcholine (PC). \u03b3-Secretase activity was quantified by measuring the amount of AICD and A\u03b2 generated during the reaction, by immunoblot or sandwich ELISA respectively, as described below.SDS-PAGE, Native PAGE, Western blotting and antibodiesTotal or microsomal protein extracts were resolved by electrophoresis on NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen) or on standard 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide Tris Glycine gels for SDS-PAGE analysis. Purified \u03b3-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE\u2122 Novex\u00ae Bis-Tris 4\u201316% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen). Silver staining was performed directly on gel according to manufacturer instructions (Biorad). For immunoblot analysis, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (Whatman), and probed with the following antibodies: anti-Nicastrin NCT164 (BD Bioscience), anti-V5-tag for NCT-V5 (Covance), MAB1563 (Millipore) or ab10281 (Abcam) for PS1 NTF, MAB5232 for PS1 CTF (Millipore), 3F10 for APH1aL-HA (Roche), anti-Flag M2 for Flag-PEN-2 or C100-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich), A8717 for APP CTF (Sigma-Aldrich), and A2066 for \u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Anti-mouse/rabbit/rat IgG conjugated to Alexa 680 were purchased from Invitrogen. The Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR) was used to detect the fluorescent signal.Quantification of A\u03b2 peptidesA\u03b2 peptides from the \u03b3-secretase assays described above were quantified by sandwich ELISA according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Three kits were used to detect human A\u03b21\u201340 (Invitrogen KHB3481) and A\u03b21\u201342 (Invitrogen KHB3544 and Wako 269-64401).Supporting Information Top Figure S1. Characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing human FAD-linked PS1 variants in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Presenilin double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Two clones per PS1 variant were selected for characterization. (A) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with various antibodies to detect the endogenous \u03b3-secretase core components: NCT (NCT164), hPS1 (NTF, MAB1563), and PEN2 (UD1), and with an antibody for APP (A8717). \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. (B) \u03b3-Secretase activity assays were performed with microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with lipids and 1 \u00b5M of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. * Indicates a non-specific band, which was not detected in microsomal protein extracts of the same cell lines using the same antibody (MAB1563) (B).

APP-CTF profiles in WT MEF, MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 and \u03b3 - PS1/2 transduced with the SPA4CT construct. WT MEF, MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 and \u03b3 - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]). Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717).(TIF)Figure S3. APH1 isoforms expressed in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Total RNAs were extracted from presenilin double-knockout MEFs, using standard procedures (Qiagen RNAeasy kit) and were quantified by spectrophotometry. One microgram of total RNAs was reverse transcribed for 1 h at 42\u00b0C by using the ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega) and oligo-dT primer in a final volume of 20 \u00b5L. PCR was next performed for each APH1 isoform on 1 \u00b5L of RT reaction by using the Roche PCR kit under standard conditions and the primers described in Table S1. The following cycling conditions were applied for all reactions: 94\u00b0C, 3 min; 30 cycles of [94\u00b0C, 30 s; 58\u00b0C, 30 s; 70\u00b0C, 40 s]; 70\u00b0C, 10 min. PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized using Alpha Innotech UV imager.(TIF)Table S1. Primers used to detect APH1 isoforms in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212.

Fraering*\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Brain Mind Institute, Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Alzheimer's Disease, Lausanne, SwitzerlandAbstract Top BackgroundMutations linked to early onset, familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are found most frequently in PSEN1, the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1). Together with nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the \u03b3-secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides. Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A\u03b2 production by enhancing the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain (AICD). Moreover, controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems, by either increasing A\u03b21\u201342 production, decreasing A\u03b21\u201340 production, or both. Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of \u03b3-secretase, we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT, APH1aL, PEN2, and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P, \u0394E9, or P436Q.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations. A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes. The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of \u03b3-secretase activity phenotype, in terms of A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro.Conclusion/SignificanceOur data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong \u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.Citation: Cacquevel M, Aeschbach L, Houacine J, Fraering PC (2012) Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified \u03b3-Secretase Complexes.

PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2, respectively, that constitute the catalytic core of \u03b3-secretase, the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional, Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases (I-CLiPs) [3]. Active \u03b3-secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin (NCT), the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and the presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2). Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue \u03b3-secretase inhibitors to PS1 [4], as well as the abolishment of \u03b3-secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [4], [5], [6], have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex.PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the \u03b3-secretase complex. The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [7], releasing their corresponding intracellular domains, which are capable of influencing gene expression. For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4, the \u03b3-secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function, whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3\u03b2 [8], the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established (see [9] for a review). The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by the successive actions of \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase, generating amyloid-beta peptides (A\u03b2) of different lengths, ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [10]. Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) by \u03b3-secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression, a major genetic determinant of AD, and in cholesterol metabolism [11]. In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate \u03b3-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].In a pathological context, 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD (www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations). It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A\u03b2 species, mainly A\u03b21\u201342, that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of the disease [15], [16]. Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Despite this growing consensus, the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A\u03b242, A\u03b240, and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations. On one hand, a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A\u03b242 production, accompanied or not with reduced A\u03b240 production, thereby leading to an increased A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio. On the other hand, reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [20]. Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A\u03b2 and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects. For example, endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis, as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A\u03b2 generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [23]. Next, it has been reported that \u03b3-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition (with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms, six combinations of \u03b3-secretase are possible), with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A\u03b2 species generated [24]. In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of \u03b3-secretase in cell-free systems, we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [25], [26], [27]. In particular, protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active \u03b3-secretase constituted of NCT, APH1aL, PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [26], [27] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 \u00c5 and 12 \u00c5 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [28], [29]. However, these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1. Here, we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human \u03b3-secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of \u03b3-secretase activity.Results Top Generation, selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutantsIn order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human \u03b3-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants, we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line that lacks the two presenilins (PS1/2\u2212/\u2212) [30], [31]. Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines, on a PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 background, that overexpress tagged versions of the three human \u03b3-secretase subunits NCT, APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1, and to purify the different human \u03b3-secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps. This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse \u03b3-secretase components. First, a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 (hNCT-V5), human APH1aL-HA (hAPH1aL-HA) and human Flag-PEN2 (Flag-hPEN2) into MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time. Next, the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected (designated \u03b3 - PS1/2) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants: PS1-WT, three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial, catalytic site aspartate residues (D257A, D385A, and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article), and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, \u0394E9 and P436Q, with mean disease onset at 24 years, 45.5 years and 28.3 years, respectively).For each PS1 variant, two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins, and extensively characterized (Figure 1). To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all \u03b3-sectease components from wild-type MEFs, they are collectively designated \u03b3-MEFs. As shown in Figure 1A, the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [23], [32]. As expected, and when compared to the parental \u03b3- PS1/2 cell line, higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones. In contrast to PEN2, APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line. Indeed, and as previously reported [23], [32], PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants, and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1. Interestingly, PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band, possibly reflecting a post-translational modification. Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones. First, and in sharp contrast to the other clones, those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 (PS1-FL; Figure 1A). As estimated by densitometry, the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87\u00b12% and 79\u00b17% of total PS1 (PS1-NTF+PS1-FL), respectively. Next, the PS1-\u0394E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments, as previously described [33], while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments, suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis.thumbnailFigure 1. Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human \u03b3-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5, Flag-hPEN2, hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line, designated as \u03b3- PS1/2, that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits. \u03b3- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Each clone, derived form the \u03b3- PS1/2, was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol \u03b3 and followed by the number of the clone (\u03b3-MEF) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF (WT MEF) and MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Two clones per \u03b3-secretase variant were selected for characterization. (A\u2013B) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 4\u201312% Bis-Tris or 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the \u03b3-secretase core components NCT (NCT164), PS1 (NTF, MAB1563; CTF; MAB5232), APH1aL-HA (3F10), and Flag-PEN2 (M2) (A), and endogenous APP (A8717) (B). \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. CTF: C-terminal fragment, FL: full-length, im.: immature NCT; m.: mature NCT, N: N-glycosylated, NTF: N-terminal fragment, O: O-glycosylated.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP. As expected, and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs (a common characteristic among known substrates in response to \u03b3-secretase pharmacological inhibition), the activity of \u03b3-secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental \u03b3 - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 (Figure 1B). In the clones expressing PS1-WT, APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high \u03b3-secretase activity, while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation. In PS1-\u0394E9 clones, a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed (Figure 1B). Although a poor recovery of \u03b3-secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1-\u0394E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [23], the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [34], [35]. Importantly, all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5, hAPH1aL-HA, Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other \u03b3-secretase components (cf. Figure S1A). These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the \u03b3-secretase.Next, we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A\u03b2 species. For this purpose, and as described elsewhere [36], we used an APP-based \u03b3-secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus (SPA4CT-Flag). This substrate was transduced in the above-described \u03b3-secretase overexpressing stable cell lines (\u03b3-MEFs) as well as in wild-type MEFs, and APP-CTFs and A\u03b2 levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media, respectively (Figure 2). Under these conditions, the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate, associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels (Figure 2A and Figure S2). As estimated by ELISA, a three-fold increase in A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase (\u03b3-MEF WT), in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs (Figure 2B). Also, the average A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were not significantly different in those cell lines (Mean \u00b1 SD: \u03b3-MEF WT#5: 0.30\u00b10.01; \u03b3-MEF WT#8: 0.29\u00b10.01; WT MEF: 0.19\u00b10.06). Next, overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in \u03b3-MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants (Figure 2C), and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A\u03b2 levels as measured by ELISA (Figure 2D). First, only traces of both A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were detected in \u03b3-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants. Next, \u03b3-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A\u03b2 levels when compared to the wild-type clones. Overall, the average A\u03b21\u201340 levels were decreased in these cell lines (Mean of two clones in pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 224.6\u00b10.1, L166P: 84.3\u00b134.2, \u0394E9: 167.2\u00b140.7, P436Q: 82.8\u00b174.7), while the A\u03b21\u201342 levels were increased (Mean of two clones in pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 69.9\u00b17.9, L166P: 310.7\u00b181.0, \u0394E9: 94.4\u00b118.5, P436Q: 141.1\u00b198.5). Consistent with previously reported data, the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were increased in all \u03b3-MEF clones overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations (Figure 2D) (Mean of two clones pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 0.31\u00b10.03, L166P: 3.8\u00b10.58, \u0394E9: 0.6\u00b10.03, P436Q: 2.0\u00b10.59).thumbnailFigure 2. A\u03b2 production in cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.WT MEF, \u03b3-MEF and \u03b3 - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus. Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717) (A, C). A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 levels were also measured in the corresponding cell culture media (B, D). Data corresponds to three independent experiments (Mean \u00b1 SEM).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified \u03b3-secretase complexesWe next assessed the activity of \u03b3-secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of \u03b3-MEFs. Membrane protein extracts were prepared and \u03b3-secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP, and referred to as C100-Flag (Figure 3A). The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry. As shown in Figure 3A, the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1-\u0394E9 clones accounted for 42\u00b11% and 13\u00b16% of that in the PS1-WT clones, respectively. AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants. Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other human \u03b3-secretase components (Figure S1B).thumbnailFigure 3. Enzymatic activity of partially purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) \u03b3-Secretase activity assays performed with \u03b3-MEF and \u03b3 - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with lipids and 1 \u00b5M of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions, reflecting \u03b3-secretase activity, were estimated by densitometry. PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. (B) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4\u00b0C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins, and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in (A). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for \u03b3-secretase subunits ((NCT164 (NCT), MAB1563 (PS1-NTF), or UD1 (PEN2)). AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody (A8717). *Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains. (C) A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL (left Y-axis) or in percentage (right Y-axis) of the mean of A\u03b21\u201340 levels generated by the two wild-type clones. A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios are indicated on the top of the bars. The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions. To do so, \u03b3-secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate. Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins (anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10, targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of \u03b3-secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions. As shown in Figure 3B, the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT, PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the \u03b3-secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used (Figures 3B). In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts (Figure 3A), those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation, when compared to PS1-WT (Figure 3B). Furthermore, levels of A\u03b21\u201340 produced from PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~6%, ~1.5% and ~0.5%, when compared to these produced from PS1-WT \u03b3-secretase. Following the same tendency, A\u03b21\u201342 levels generated from PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9 and PS1-P436Q \u03b3-secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~20%, ~5% and ~3% of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes. The A\u03b21-42/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio measured for WT \u03b3-MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data (compare Figures 2D and 3C), validating our in vitro experimental conditions. Interestingly, an overall A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio of ~1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants, with the exception of P436Q#4 (~2). However, in the latter, the ratio may have been overestimated because the A\u03b21\u201340 levels measured were at the detection limit. This similarity in the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios generated by the different mutants has, to the best of our knowledge, never been observed in previous studies.Highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotypeIn order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions, we purified to homogeneity \u03b3-secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1. The purification process (described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts. Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background, this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively \u03b3-secretase complexes made of human components. As highlighted in Figure 4B, our protocol led to the production of stable, high molecular weight \u03b3-secretase complexes (HMWCs) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native (BN)-PAGE of ~350 kDa, which is consistent with previous reports [26], [27], [37]. The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes (Figure 4B, upper panel), for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 (Figure 4B, lower panels). As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different \u03b3-secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates, it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar (Figure 4B), thus facilitating further comparative analyses. The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes (Figure 4C) confirmed the presence of all core components (NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, Flag-PEN2 and PS1) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1. Interestingly, the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified \u03b3-secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification (Figure 1A), indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations. To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect \u03b3-secretase activity in these purified complexes, we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate (Figure 3A) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes, immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity. As shown in Figure 5A, \u03b3-secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones. This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions (Figure 5A). Next, sandwich ELISAs directed against A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes. Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA, the production of both A\u03b2 species by \u03b3-secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants (Figure 5B). The A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio measured in PS1-WT \u03b3-secretase complexes (~0.22) was similar to that previously reported [26], [27], thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of \u03b3-secretase activity with this protocol. Together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P, \u0394E9, and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss (at least 90% as estimated by ELISA) of \u03b3-secretase activity.thumbnailFigure 4. High-grade purification of human \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) Schematic representation of the \u03b3-secretase purification process. Briefly, Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human \u03b3-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants. Next, these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods. (B) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified \u03b3-secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants. Equal volumes of the different purified \u03b3-secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4\u201316% Bis-Tris gel, and stained with silver nitrate (top panel), or immunostained for NCT (NCT164, middle panel) or PS1-NTF (ab10281, bottom panel) as indicated. \u03b3-Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes (HMWCs) of ~350 kDa. Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones. (C) Equal volumes of purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) and immunostained with anti-NCT (NCT164), anti-PS1-NTF (MAB1563), anti-PS1-CTF (MAB5232), anti-HA (3F10), or anti-Flag (M2) antibodies. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g004 thumbnailFigure 5. Enzymatic activity of highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants.Equal amounts of the different purified \u03b3-secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag, as described in Figure 3. The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody (M2) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag (A), and by sandwich ELISA for A\u03b21\u201340 or A\u03b21\u201342 (B). Note that the levels of A\u03b2 produced from FAD-linked \u03b3-secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards, close to the detection limit. Whenever possible, A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by \u03b3-secretase have been reported. First, it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A\u03b21\u201342 [15], [38]. Since A\u03b21\u201342, the first A\u03b2 specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [16], [39], is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A\u03b2 species [40], [41], [42], it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [43]. This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A\u03b2 accumulation and deposition in the brain [44], [45]. However, Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A\u03b2 production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [23]. These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo. By extension, we hypothesized that the other components of \u03b3-secretase, namely APH1, NCT and PEN2, may influence the mutant phenotype as well. Indeed, \u03b3-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2. Therefore, it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct \u03b3-secretase subtypes. This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A\u03b2 profiles. When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A\u03b2 species [24]. With this regard, it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [23] and employed here (cf. Figure S3). Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems, we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems, by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human \u03b3-secretase components. Under these conditions, the biochemical and functional properties of \u03b3-secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, \u0394E9, and P436Q), dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized. The activity of \u03b3-secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for \u03b3-secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5, APH1aL, Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [26], [27], that resulted in A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3. In contrast, we found a major loss in the activity of \u03b3-secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of \u03b3-secretase [5], [6], [32], the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected. Indeed, the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A\u03b21\u201342 levels both in vivo [46] and in vitro [20], in the presence of endogenous PS1, PS2 and APH1 components. In contrast, Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 production in a PS knockout background. These results are consistent with our in vitro data, although the reduction in A\u03b21\u201342 and A\u03b21\u201340 production was more pronounced in our system. However, they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A\u03b21\u201342 associated with a decrease in A\u03b21\u201340. Taken together, these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of \u03b3-secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations. Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use, in previously described cellular systems, of APP carrying the Swedish mutation (K670M/N671L) [20], [23], [46]. Initially, this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A\u03b2 species by favouring its \u03b2-secretase cleavage [47], [48]. However, Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the \u03b3-secretase cleavage [49]. In particular, these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A\u03b242, associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A\u03b2, compared with the wild-type APP. Therefore, one cannot exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants, as suggested earlier [50].As far as the PS1-\u0394E9 mutant is concerned, previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A\u03b240 levels associated with an increase in A\u03b242 levels [51], [52], or no changes in A\u03b240 levels despite increased A\u03b242 levels [53], or a decrease in both A\u03b2 species [23]. In the present study, A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342, as well as AICD levels generated from purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with PS1-\u0394E9 were close to the limit of detection, resulting in a loss of at least 95% of the \u03b3-secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1. Similarly, we found a near to complete loss of \u03b3-secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant (mean onset: 28.3 years) [54]. Consistent with a recent study [35], and in contrast to PS1-L166P, the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired. Interestingly, the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased \u03b3-secretase activity and A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells (~75% or ~50% of the control for A\u03b240 or A\u03b242, respectively), but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study (more than 97% for both A\u03b2 species).Overall, our data show that, under our experimental conditions, the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity (at least 90%) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified \u03b3-secretase complexes. This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A\u03b21\u201342 levels were relatively less affected than A\u03b21\u201340 levels. Interestingly, the ratio between the two A\u03b2 species was similar for the variants tested here (~1), suggesting a common modulatory mechanism. Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of \u03b3-secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio compared to PS1-WT, as previously observed in vivo [15], [38]. Taken together, the overall reduction in A\u03b2 levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions. Indeed, even if A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions, A\u03b2 production was strikingly different.One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of \u03b3-secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations. For instance, it remains unknown whether \u03b3-secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations. In support to that regard, Winkler and colleagues recently purified human \u03b3-secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes, containing both APH1a and AHP1b, led to increased A\u03b21\u201342 production associated with decreased A\u03b21\u201340 production, as compared to the PS1-WT complexes. Another possible explanation would be that purified \u03b3-secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates, due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins. These include TMP21 or the recently reported \u03b3-secretase activating protein (GSAP) [12], [13]. Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis.The loss of activity in \u03b3-secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD. As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes, including the neprilysin [55], and the lipoprotein receptor, LRP1 [11], it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo. For instance, it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A\u03b2 metabolism in return. In support to these views, Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants, albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [56]. They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone, suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions. These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [57]. Altogether, the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of \u03b3-secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD. They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting \u03b3-secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [58]. Supporting this view, the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, but actually made it worse [59].Collectively, our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A\u03b2 pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A\u03b2 species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by \u03b3-secretase substrates. This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease. Since it has been established that A\u03b2 and AICD are generated following the processing by \u03b3-secretase at two distinct gamma- and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [60], further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP, as well as in other known \u03b3-secretase substrates.Materials and Methods Top DNA Constructs and mutagenesisNCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA, wild-type PS1 human cDNAs (PS1-WT) were obtained from D. Selkoe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). PS1 \u0394E9 cDNA was obtained from C. Saura (Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Spain). PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A cDNAs were obtained from M. Wolfe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). Mutations in PSEN1, namely, L166P and P436Q, were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis on the plasmid pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)-PS1-WT using T7 or BGH primers (specific to the plasmid DNA sequence) together with the corresponding primers: L166P Rv: 5\u2032 CAG CAA CAA Taa gct tGA TAT AAT AGG 3\u2032; L166P Fw: 5\u2032 CTT ATT ATA TCa agc ttA TTG TTG CTG 3\u2032; P436Q Rv: 5\u2032 TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTC TTG AAA ATG GCA AGG AG 3\u2032; P436Q Fw: 5\u2032 TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTG CCA GCT CTT CAA ATC TCC 3\u2032. The sequences corresponding to enzyme restriction sites are given in small letters. The PCR fragments were next digested with BamHI/HindIII and HindIII/XhoI respectively, and were subcloned into pcDNA3. PS1 D257A/D385A (DDAA) was obtained by subcloning the DraI/XhoI digested fragment of PS1 D385A into pcDNA3.1-PS1 D257A. The APP based substrate SPA4CT-Flag, corresponding to the signal peptide of APP fused to the APP-C99-Flag with a small linker region (DA) [36], was obtained by removing the HindIII/EcoRI fragment of pcDNA3-APP695-Flag and inserting the following annealed primers: 5\u2032 AGC TTA TGC TGC CCG GTT TG GCA CTG CTC CTG CTG GCC GCC TGG ACG GCT CGG GCG GAT GCA GAT GCA G 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 AAT TCT GCA TCT GCA TCC GCC CGA GCC GTC CAG GCG GCC AGC AGG AGC AGT GCC AAA CCG GGC AGC ATA 3\u2032. All constructs were next subcloned into the self-inactivated vector pSIN-PGK-WHV cassette (a kind gift from R. Zufferey, Brain Mind Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland). Inserts for plasmids pET21-C100-Flag, and pET21-C100-His were generated by PCR as previously described [27]. Plasmids pMD2G and psPAX2 were obtained from D. Trono (Global Health Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland).Lentivector productionReplication-defective lentiviral particles were produced by a three-plasmid transient transfection of cells from the human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cell line [61]. Briefly, cells were incubated in 10 cm dishes until they reached 70% confluence and were transiently co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method, with 5 \u00b5g of envelope plasmid (pMD2G), 15 \u00b5g of packaging plasmid (psPAX2), and 20 \u00b5g of vector plasmids (pSIN-PGK-WHV). Cells were incubated overnight with DNA-calcium precipitates, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) and incubated with 7 mL of DMEM. After 24 h, the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled, passed through 0.45 \u00b5m filter, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C as 2 mL aliquots until use. A p24 ELISA (Zeptometrix corporation) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated.Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductionsMouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs, obtained from B. De Strooper, Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology, Belgium) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [30], [31] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen). A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors (LV) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage (1/20). Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection. The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins (designated \u03b3 - PS1/2) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants, by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT, PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9, PS1-P436Q, PS1-D257A, PS1-D385A, and PS1-DDAA. For each PS1 variant, five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for \u03b3-secretase purification. For SPA4CT overexpression experiments, 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM, 1% FBS, P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM, 2% FBS, P/S for 24 h. Finally, cell culture medium was harvested, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000\u00d7 rpm and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing. Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction.Protein extractionTotal protein extracts were prepared in 1% NP40 - HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000\u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7 g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).Multi-step purification of human \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1) Cell membrane preparation. MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells (1.0\u00d7109 cells) expressing NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1: wild type (WT), or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues, were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer (50 mM MES, pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Next, cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer (Emulsiflex-C5, Avestin Inc, ON Canada) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000\u00d7 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C in a SW32Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet. 2) Bicarbonate wash. The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 11.3) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times, and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. 3) Solubilisation of \u03b3-secretase complexes. The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times. The membranes were then incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant saved. This lysate is defined as \u201csolubilised \u03b3-secretase preparation\u201d. Next, these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of \u03b3-secretase complexes as described below. 4) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification. The solubilised \u03b3-secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer, and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) (final detergent concentration: 0.08% CHAPSO, 0.08% digitonin) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with agitation after adding 200 \u00b5L of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 \u00b5g/mL of Flag peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated \u201cM2 pooled 800 \u00b5L fractions\u201d. 5) Anti-V5 affinity purification. The M2 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1 mL with 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with 200 \u00b5L of anti-V5 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin-TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted for 1 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 500 \u00b5g/mL of V5 peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated 4 times, and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated \u201cV5 pooled 1.6 mL fractions\u201d. 6) Anti-HA affinity purification. As a final purification step, the V5 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1.8 mL with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with 200 \u00b5L of anti-HA affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted overnight at 4\u00b0C with 0.2 mL of this buffer containing 200 \u00b5g/mL of HA peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once, for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, and the two eluted fractions were kept separately, designated \u201cHA fraction E1\u201d and \u201cHA fraction E2\u201d.Co-immunoprecipitationCo-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts. Briefly, 100 \u00b5g of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche), and 50 \u00b5L of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. Samples were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer. Finally, beads were resuspended in 50 \u00b5L of 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro \u03b3-secretase assays.In vitro \u03b3-secretase activity assaysIn vitro \u03b3-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27]. \u03b3-Secretase APP-based substrates were expressed in E. coli transfected with plasmids pET21-C100-Flag or pET21-C100-His as a fusion protein consisting of a Met for translation initiation, and either the Flag tag sequence (C100-Flag) or the His tag sequence (C100-His), and were affinity purified using an anti-Flag resin (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) or an Ni-NTA agarose resin (Invitrogen), respectively. In vitro assays were performed at 37\u00b0C for 4 h, with 1 \u00b5M of recombinant substrate, 0.025% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and 0.1% phosphatidylcholine (PC). \u03b3-Secretase activity was quantified by measuring the amount of AICD and A\u03b2 generated during the reaction, by immunoblot or sandwich ELISA respectively, as described below.SDS-PAGE, Native PAGE, Western blotting and antibodiesTotal or microsomal protein extracts were resolved by electrophoresis on NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen) or on standard 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide Tris Glycine gels for SDS-PAGE analysis. Purified \u03b3-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE\u2122 Novex\u00ae Bis-Tris 4\u201316% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen). Silver staining was performed directly on gel according to manufacturer instructions (Biorad). For immunoblot analysis, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (Whatman), and probed with the following antibodies: anti-Nicastrin NCT164 (BD Bioscience), anti-V5-tag for NCT-V5 (Covance), MAB1563 (Millipore) or ab10281 (Abcam) for PS1 NTF, MAB5232 for PS1 CTF (Millipore), 3F10 for APH1aL-HA (Roche), anti-Flag M2 for Flag-PEN-2 or C100-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich), A8717 for APP CTF (Sigma-Aldrich), and A2066 for \u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).

The Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR) was used to detect the fluorescent signal.Quantification of A\u03b2 peptidesA\u03b2 peptides from the \u03b3-secretase assays described above were quantified by sandwich ELISA according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Three kits were used to detect human A\u03b21\u201340 (Invitrogen KHB3481) and A\u03b21\u201342 (Invitrogen KHB3544 and Wako 269-64401).Supporting Information Top Figure S1. Characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing human FAD-linked PS1 variants in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Presenilin double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Two clones per PS1 variant were selected for characterization. (A) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with various antibodies to detect the endogenous \u03b3-secretase core components: NCT (NCT164), hPS1 (NTF, MAB1563), and PEN2 (UD1), and with an antibody for APP (A8717). \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. (B) \u03b3-Secretase activity assays were performed with microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with lipids and 1 \u00b5M of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. * Indicates a non-specific band, which was not detected in microsomal protein extracts of the same cell lines using the same antibody (MAB1563) (B).

Fraering*\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Brain Mind Institute, Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Alzheimer's Disease, Lausanne, SwitzerlandAbstract Top BackgroundMutations linked to early onset, familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are found most frequently in PSEN1, the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1). Together with nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the \u03b3-secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides. Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A\u03b2 production by enhancing the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain (AICD). Moreover, controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems, by either increasing A\u03b21\u201342 production, decreasing A\u03b21\u201340 production, or both. Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of \u03b3-secretase, we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT, APH1aL, PEN2, and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P, \u0394E9, or P436Q.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations. A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes. The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of \u03b3-secretase activity phenotype, in terms of A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro.Conclusion/SignificanceOur data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong \u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.Citation: Cacquevel M, Aeschbach L, Houacine J, Fraering PC (2012) Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified \u03b3-Secretase Complexes.

PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2, respectively, that constitute the catalytic core of \u03b3-secretase, the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional, Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases (I-CLiPs) [3]. Active \u03b3-secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin (NCT), the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and the presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2). Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue \u03b3-secretase inhibitors to PS1 [4], as well as the abolishment of \u03b3-secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [4], [5], [6], have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex.PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the \u03b3-secretase complex. The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [7], releasing their corresponding intracellular domains, which are capable of influencing gene expression. For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4, the \u03b3-secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function, whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3\u03b2 [8], the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established (see [9] for a review). The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by the successive actions of \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase, generating amyloid-beta peptides (A\u03b2) of different lengths, ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [10]. Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) by \u03b3-secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression, a major genetic determinant of AD, and in cholesterol metabolism [11]. In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate \u03b3-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].In a pathological context, 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD (www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations). It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A\u03b2 species, mainly A\u03b21\u201342, that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of the disease [15], [16]. Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Despite this growing consensus, the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A\u03b242, A\u03b240, and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations. On one hand, a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A\u03b242 production, accompanied or not with reduced A\u03b240 production, thereby leading to an increased A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio. On the other hand, reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [20]. Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A\u03b2 and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects. For example, endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis, as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A\u03b2 generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [23]. Next, it has been reported that \u03b3-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition (with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms, six combinations of \u03b3-secretase are possible), with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A\u03b2 species generated [24]. In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of \u03b3-secretase in cell-free systems, we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [25], [26], [27]. In particular, protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active \u03b3-secretase constituted of NCT, APH1aL, PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [26], [27] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 \u00c5 and 12 \u00c5 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [28], [29]. However, these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1. Here, we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human \u03b3-secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of \u03b3-secretase activity.Results Top Generation, selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutantsIn order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human \u03b3-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants, we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line that lacks the two presenilins (PS1/2\u2212/\u2212) [30], [31]. Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines, on a PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 background, that overexpress tagged versions of the three human \u03b3-secretase subunits NCT, APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1, and to purify the different human \u03b3-secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps. This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse \u03b3-secretase components. First, a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 (hNCT-V5), human APH1aL-HA (hAPH1aL-HA) and human Flag-PEN2 (Flag-hPEN2) into MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time. Next, the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected (designated \u03b3 - PS1/2) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants: PS1-WT, three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial, catalytic site aspartate residues (D257A, D385A, and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article), and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, \u0394E9 and P436Q, with mean disease onset at 24 years, 45.5 years and 28.3 years, respectively).For each PS1 variant, two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins, and extensively characterized (Figure 1). To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all \u03b3-sectease components from wild-type MEFs, they are collectively designated \u03b3-MEFs. As shown in Figure 1A, the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [23], [32]. As expected, and when compared to the parental \u03b3- PS1/2 cell line, higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones. In contrast to PEN2, APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line. Indeed, and as previously reported [23], [32], PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants, and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1. Interestingly, PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band, possibly reflecting a post-translational modification. Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones. First, and in sharp contrast to the other clones, those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 (PS1-FL; Figure 1A). As estimated by densitometry, the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87\u00b12% and 79\u00b17% of total PS1 (PS1-NTF+PS1-FL), respectively. Next, the PS1-\u0394E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments, as previously described [33], while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments, suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis.thumbnailFigure 1. Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human \u03b3-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5, Flag-hPEN2, hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line, designated as \u03b3- PS1/2, that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits. \u03b3- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Each clone, derived form the \u03b3- PS1/2, was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol \u03b3 and followed by the number of the clone (\u03b3-MEF) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF (WT MEF) and MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Two clones per \u03b3-secretase variant were selected for characterization. (A\u2013B) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 4\u201312% Bis-Tris or 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the \u03b3-secretase core components NCT (NCT164), PS1 (NTF, MAB1563; CTF; MAB5232), APH1aL-HA (3F10), and Flag-PEN2 (M2) (A), and endogenous APP (A8717) (B). \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. CTF: C-terminal fragment, FL: full-length, im.: immature NCT; m.: mature NCT, N: N-glycosylated, NTF: N-terminal fragment, O: O-glycosylated.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP. As expected, and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs (a common characteristic among known substrates in response to \u03b3-secretase pharmacological inhibition), the activity of \u03b3-secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental \u03b3 - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 (Figure 1B). In the clones expressing PS1-WT, APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high \u03b3-secretase activity, while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation. In PS1-\u0394E9 clones, a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed (Figure 1B). Although a poor recovery of \u03b3-secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1-\u0394E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [23], the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [34], [35]. Importantly, all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5, hAPH1aL-HA, Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other \u03b3-secretase components (cf. Figure S1A). These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the \u03b3-secretase.Next, we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A\u03b2 species. For this purpose, and as described elsewhere [36], we used an APP-based \u03b3-secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus (SPA4CT-Flag). This substrate was transduced in the above-described \u03b3-secretase overexpressing stable cell lines (\u03b3-MEFs) as well as in wild-type MEFs, and APP-CTFs and A\u03b2 levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media, respectively (Figure 2). Under these conditions, the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate, associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels (Figure 2A and Figure S2). As estimated by ELISA, a three-fold increase in A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase (\u03b3-MEF WT), in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs (Figure 2B). Also, the average A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were not significantly different in those cell lines (Mean \u00b1 SD: \u03b3-MEF WT#5: 0.30\u00b10.01; \u03b3-MEF WT#8: 0.29\u00b10.01; WT MEF: 0.19\u00b10.06). Next, overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in \u03b3-MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants (Figure 2C), and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A\u03b2 levels as measured by ELISA (Figure 2D). First, only traces of both A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were detected in \u03b3-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants. Next, \u03b3-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A\u03b2 levels when compared to the wild-type clones. Overall, the average A\u03b21\u201340 levels were decreased in these cell lines (Mean of two clones in pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 224.6\u00b10.1, L166P: 84.3\u00b134.2, \u0394E9: 167.2\u00b140.7, P436Q: 82.8\u00b174.7), while the A\u03b21\u201342 levels were increased (Mean of two clones in pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 69.9\u00b17.9, L166P: 310.7\u00b181.0, \u0394E9: 94.4\u00b118.5, P436Q: 141.1\u00b198.5). Consistent with previously reported data, the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were increased in all \u03b3-MEF clones overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations (Figure 2D) (Mean of two clones pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 0.31\u00b10.03, L166P: 3.8\u00b10.58, \u0394E9: 0.6\u00b10.03, P436Q: 2.0\u00b10.59).thumbnailFigure 2. A\u03b2 production in cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.WT MEF, \u03b3-MEF and \u03b3 - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus. Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717) (A, C). A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 levels were also measured in the corresponding cell culture media (B, D). Data corresponds to three independent experiments (Mean \u00b1 SEM).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified \u03b3-secretase complexesWe next assessed the activity of \u03b3-secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of \u03b3-MEFs. Membrane protein extracts were prepared and \u03b3-secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP, and referred to as C100-Flag (Figure 3A). The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry. As shown in Figure 3A, the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1-\u0394E9 clones accounted for 42\u00b11% and 13\u00b16% of that in the PS1-WT clones, respectively. AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants. Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other human \u03b3-secretase components (Figure S1B).thumbnailFigure 3. Enzymatic activity of partially purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) \u03b3-Secretase activity assays performed with \u03b3-MEF and \u03b3 - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with lipids and 1 \u00b5M of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions, reflecting \u03b3-secretase activity, were estimated by densitometry. PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. (B) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4\u00b0C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins, and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in (A). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for \u03b3-secretase subunits ((NCT164 (NCT), MAB1563 (PS1-NTF), or UD1 (PEN2)). AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody (A8717). *Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains. (C) A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL (left Y-axis) or in percentage (right Y-axis) of the mean of A\u03b21\u201340 levels generated by the two wild-type clones. A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios are indicated on the top of the bars. The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions. To do so, \u03b3-secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate. Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins (anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10, targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of \u03b3-secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions. As shown in Figure 3B, the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT, PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the \u03b3-secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used (Figures 3B). In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts (Figure 3A), those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation, when compared to PS1-WT (Figure 3B). Furthermore, levels of A\u03b21\u201340 produced from PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~6%, ~1.5% and ~0.5%, when compared to these produced from PS1-WT \u03b3-secretase. Following the same tendency, A\u03b21\u201342 levels generated from PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9 and PS1-P436Q \u03b3-secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~20%, ~5% and ~3% of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes. The A\u03b21-42/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio measured for WT \u03b3-MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data (compare Figures 2D and 3C), validating our in vitro experimental conditions. Interestingly, an overall A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio of ~1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants, with the exception of P436Q#4 (~2). However, in the latter, the ratio may have been overestimated because the A\u03b21\u201340 levels measured were at the detection limit. This similarity in the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios generated by the different mutants has, to the best of our knowledge, never been observed in previous studies.Highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotypeIn order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions, we purified to homogeneity \u03b3-secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1. The purification process (described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts. Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background, this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively \u03b3-secretase complexes made of human components. As highlighted in Figure 4B, our protocol led to the production of stable, high molecular weight \u03b3-secretase complexes (HMWCs) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native (BN)-PAGE of ~350 kDa, which is consistent with previous reports [26], [27], [37]. The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes (Figure 4B, upper panel), for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 (Figure 4B, lower panels). As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different \u03b3-secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates, it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar (Figure 4B), thus facilitating further comparative analyses. The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes (Figure 4C) confirmed the presence of all core components (NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, Flag-PEN2 and PS1) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1. Interestingly, the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified \u03b3-secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification (Figure 1A), indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations. To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect \u03b3-secretase activity in these purified complexes, we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate (Figure 3A) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes, immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity. As shown in Figure 5A, \u03b3-secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones. This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions (Figure 5A). Next, sandwich ELISAs directed against A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes. Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA, the production of both A\u03b2 species by \u03b3-secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants (Figure 5B). The A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio measured in PS1-WT \u03b3-secretase complexes (~0.22) was similar to that previously reported [26], [27], thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of \u03b3-secretase activity with this protocol. Together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P, \u0394E9, and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss (at least 90% as estimated by ELISA) of \u03b3-secretase activity.thumbnailFigure 4. High-grade purification of human \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) Schematic representation of the \u03b3-secretase purification process. Briefly, Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human \u03b3-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants. Next, these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods. (B) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified \u03b3-secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants. Equal volumes of the different purified \u03b3-secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4\u201316% Bis-Tris gel, and stained with silver nitrate (top panel), or immunostained for NCT (NCT164, middle panel) or PS1-NTF (ab10281, bottom panel) as indicated. \u03b3-Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes (HMWCs) of ~350 kDa. Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones. (C) Equal volumes of purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) and immunostained with anti-NCT (NCT164), anti-PS1-NTF (MAB1563), anti-PS1-CTF (MAB5232), anti-HA (3F10), or anti-Flag (M2) antibodies. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g004 thumbnailFigure 5. Enzymatic activity of highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants.Equal amounts of the different purified \u03b3-secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag, as described in Figure 3. The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody (M2) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag (A), and by sandwich ELISA for A\u03b21\u201340 or A\u03b21\u201342 (B). Note that the levels of A\u03b2 produced from FAD-linked \u03b3-secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards, close to the detection limit. Whenever possible, A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by \u03b3-secretase have been reported. First, it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A\u03b21\u201342 [15], [38]. Since A\u03b21\u201342, the first A\u03b2 specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [16], [39], is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A\u03b2 species [40], [41], [42], it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [43]. This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A\u03b2 accumulation and deposition in the brain [44], [45]. However, Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A\u03b2 production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [23]. These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo. By extension, we hypothesized that the other components of \u03b3-secretase, namely APH1, NCT and PEN2, may influence the mutant phenotype as well. Indeed, \u03b3-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2. Therefore, it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct \u03b3-secretase subtypes. This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A\u03b2 profiles. When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A\u03b2 species [24]. With this regard, it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [23] and employed here (cf. Figure S3). Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems, we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems, by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human \u03b3-secretase components. Under these conditions, the biochemical and functional properties of \u03b3-secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, \u0394E9, and P436Q), dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized. The activity of \u03b3-secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for \u03b3-secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5, APH1aL, Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [26], [27], that resulted in A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3. In contrast, we found a major loss in the activity of \u03b3-secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of \u03b3-secretase [5], [6], [32], the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected. Indeed, the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A\u03b21\u201342 levels both in vivo [46] and in vitro [20], in the presence of endogenous PS1, PS2 and APH1 components. In contrast, Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 production in a PS knockout background. These results are consistent with our in vitro data, although the reduction in A\u03b21\u201342 and A\u03b21\u201340 production was more pronounced in our system. However, they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A\u03b21\u201342 associated with a decrease in A\u03b21\u201340. Taken together, these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of \u03b3-secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations. Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use, in previously described cellular systems, of APP carrying the Swedish mutation (K670M/N671L) [20], [23], [46]. Initially, this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A\u03b2 species by favouring its \u03b2-secretase cleavage [47], [48]. However, Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the \u03b3-secretase cleavage [49]. In particular, these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A\u03b242, associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A\u03b2, compared with the wild-type APP. Therefore, one cannot exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants, as suggested earlier [50].As far as the PS1-\u0394E9 mutant is concerned, previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A\u03b240 levels associated with an increase in A\u03b242 levels [51], [52], or no changes in A\u03b240 levels despite increased A\u03b242 levels [53], or a decrease in both A\u03b2 species [23]. In the present study, A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342, as well as AICD levels generated from purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with PS1-\u0394E9 were close to the limit of detection, resulting in a loss of at least 95% of the \u03b3-secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1. Similarly, we found a near to complete loss of \u03b3-secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant (mean onset: 28.3 years) [54]. Consistent with a recent study [35], and in contrast to PS1-L166P, the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired. Interestingly, the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased \u03b3-secretase activity and A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells (~75% or ~50% of the control for A\u03b240 or A\u03b242, respectively), but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study (more than 97% for both A\u03b2 species).Overall, our data show that, under our experimental conditions, the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity (at least 90%) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified \u03b3-secretase complexes. This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A\u03b21\u201342 levels were relatively less affected than A\u03b21\u201340 levels. Interestingly, the ratio between the two A\u03b2 species was similar for the variants tested here (~1), suggesting a common modulatory mechanism. Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of \u03b3-secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio compared to PS1-WT, as previously observed in vivo [15], [38]. Taken together, the overall reduction in A\u03b2 levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions. Indeed, even if A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions, A\u03b2 production was strikingly different.One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of \u03b3-secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations. For instance, it remains unknown whether \u03b3-secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations. In support to that regard, Winkler and colleagues recently purified human \u03b3-secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes, containing both APH1a and AHP1b, led to increased A\u03b21\u201342 production associated with decreased A\u03b21\u201340 production, as compared to the PS1-WT complexes. Another possible explanation would be that purified \u03b3-secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates, due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins. These include TMP21 or the recently reported \u03b3-secretase activating protein (GSAP) [12], [13]. Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis.The loss of activity in \u03b3-secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD. As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes, including the neprilysin [55], and the lipoprotein receptor, LRP1 [11], it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo. For instance, it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A\u03b2 metabolism in return. In support to these views, Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants, albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [56]. They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone, suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions. These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [57]. Altogether, the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of \u03b3-secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD. They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting \u03b3-secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [58]. Supporting this view, the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, but actually made it worse [59].Collectively, our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A\u03b2 pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A\u03b2 species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by \u03b3-secretase substrates. This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease. Since it has been established that A\u03b2 and AICD are generated following the processing by \u03b3-secretase at two distinct gamma- and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [60], further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP, as well as in other known \u03b3-secretase substrates.Materials and Methods Top DNA Constructs and mutagenesisNCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA, wild-type PS1 human cDNAs (PS1-WT) were obtained from D. Selkoe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). PS1 \u0394E9 cDNA was obtained from C. Saura (Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Spain). PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A cDNAs were obtained from M. Wolfe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). Mutations in PSEN1, namely, L166P and P436Q, were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis on the plasmid pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)-PS1-WT using T7 or BGH primers (specific to the plasmid DNA sequence) together with the corresponding primers: L166P Rv: 5\u2032 CAG CAA CAA Taa gct tGA TAT AAT AGG 3\u2032; L166P Fw: 5\u2032 CTT ATT ATA TCa agc ttA TTG TTG CTG 3\u2032; P436Q Rv: 5\u2032 TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTC TTG AAA ATG GCA AGG AG 3\u2032; P436Q Fw: 5\u2032 TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTG CCA GCT CTT CAA ATC TCC 3\u2032. The sequences corresponding to enzyme restriction sites are given in small letters. The PCR fragments were next digested with BamHI/HindIII and HindIII/XhoI respectively, and were subcloned into pcDNA3. PS1 D257A/D385A (DDAA) was obtained by subcloning the DraI/XhoI digested fragment of PS1 D385A into pcDNA3.1-PS1 D257A. The APP based substrate SPA4CT-Flag, corresponding to the signal peptide of APP fused to the APP-C99-Flag with a small linker region (DA) [36], was obtained by removing the HindIII/EcoRI fragment of pcDNA3-APP695-Flag and inserting the following annealed primers: 5\u2032 AGC TTA TGC TGC CCG GTT TG GCA CTG CTC CTG CTG GCC GCC TGG ACG GCT CGG GCG GAT GCA GAT GCA G 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 AAT TCT GCA TCT GCA TCC GCC CGA GCC GTC CAG GCG GCC AGC AGG AGC AGT GCC AAA CCG GGC AGC ATA 3\u2032. All constructs were next subcloned into the self-inactivated vector pSIN-PGK-WHV cassette (a kind gift from R. Zufferey, Brain Mind Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland). Inserts for plasmids pET21-C100-Flag, and pET21-C100-His were generated by PCR as previously described [27]. Plasmids pMD2G and psPAX2 were obtained from D. Trono (Global Health Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland).Lentivector productionReplication-defective lentiviral particles were produced by a three-plasmid transient transfection of cells from the human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cell line [61]. Briefly, cells were incubated in 10 cm dishes until they reached 70% confluence and were transiently co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method, with 5 \u00b5g of envelope plasmid (pMD2G), 15 \u00b5g of packaging plasmid (psPAX2), and 20 \u00b5g of vector plasmids (pSIN-PGK-WHV). Cells were incubated overnight with DNA-calcium precipitates, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) and incubated with 7 mL of DMEM. After 24 h, the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled, passed through 0.45 \u00b5m filter, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C as 2 mL aliquots until use. A p24 ELISA (Zeptometrix corporation) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated.Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductionsMouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs, obtained from B. De Strooper, Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology, Belgium) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [30], [31] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen). A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors (LV) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage (1/20). Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection. The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins (designated \u03b3 - PS1/2) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants, by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT, PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9, PS1-P436Q, PS1-D257A, PS1-D385A, and PS1-DDAA. For each PS1 variant, five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for \u03b3-secretase purification. For SPA4CT overexpression experiments, 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM, 1% FBS, P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM, 2% FBS, P/S for 24 h. Finally, cell culture medium was harvested, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000\u00d7 rpm and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing. Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction.Protein extractionTotal protein extracts were prepared in 1% NP40 - HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000\u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7 g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).Multi-step purification of human \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1) Cell membrane preparation. MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells (1.0\u00d7109 cells) expressing NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1: wild type (WT), or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues, were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer (50 mM MES, pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Next, cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer (Emulsiflex-C5, Avestin Inc, ON Canada) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000\u00d7 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C in a SW32Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet. 2) Bicarbonate wash. The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 11.3) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times, and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. 3) Solubilisation of \u03b3-secretase complexes. The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times. The membranes were then incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant saved. This lysate is defined as \u201csolubilised \u03b3-secretase preparation\u201d. Next, these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of \u03b3-secretase complexes as described below. 4) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification. The solubilised \u03b3-secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer, and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) (final detergent concentration: 0.08% CHAPSO, 0.08% digitonin) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with agitation after adding 200 \u00b5L of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 \u00b5g/mL of Flag peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated \u201cM2 pooled 800 \u00b5L fractions\u201d. 5) Anti-V5 affinity purification. The M2 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1 mL with 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with 200 \u00b5L of anti-V5 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin-TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted for 1 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 500 \u00b5g/mL of V5 peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated 4 times, and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated \u201cV5 pooled 1.6 mL fractions\u201d. 6) Anti-HA affinity purification. As a final purification step, the V5 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1.8 mL with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with 200 \u00b5L of anti-HA affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted overnight at 4\u00b0C with 0.2 mL of this buffer containing 200 \u00b5g/mL of HA peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once, for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, and the two eluted fractions were kept separately, designated \u201cHA fraction E1\u201d and \u201cHA fraction E2\u201d.Co-immunoprecipitationCo-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts. Briefly, 100 \u00b5g of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche), and 50 \u00b5L of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. Samples were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer. Finally, beads were resuspended in 50 \u00b5L of 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro \u03b3-secretase assays.In vitro \u03b3-secretase activity assaysIn vitro \u03b3-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27]. \u03b3-Secretase APP-based substrates were expressed in E. coli transfected with plasmids pET21-C100-Flag or pET21-C100-His as a fusion protein consisting of a Met for translation initiation, and either the Flag tag sequence (C100-Flag) or the His tag sequence (C100-His), and were affinity purified using an anti-Flag resin (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) or an Ni-NTA agarose resin (Invitrogen), respectively. In vitro assays were performed at 37\u00b0C for 4 h, with 1 \u00b5M of recombinant substrate, 0.025% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and 0.1% phosphatidylcholine (PC). \u03b3-Secretase activity was quantified by measuring the amount of AICD and A\u03b2 generated during the reaction, by immunoblot or sandwich ELISA respectively, as described below.SDS-PAGE, Native PAGE, Western blotting and antibodiesTotal or microsomal protein extracts were resolved by electrophoresis on NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen) or on standard 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide Tris Glycine gels for SDS-PAGE analysis. Purified \u03b3-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE\u2122 Novex\u00ae Bis-Tris 4\u201316% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen). Silver staining was performed directly on gel according to manufacturer instructions (Biorad). For immunoblot analysis, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (Whatman), and probed with the following antibodies: anti-Nicastrin NCT164 (BD Bioscience), anti-V5-tag for NCT-V5 (Covance), MAB1563 (Millipore) or ab10281 (Abcam) for PS1 NTF, MAB5232 for PS1 CTF (Millipore), 3F10 for APH1aL-HA (Roche), anti-Flag M2 for Flag-PEN-2 or C100-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich), A8717 for APP CTF (Sigma-Aldrich), and A2066 for \u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Anti-mouse/rabbit/rat IgG conjugated to Alexa 680 were purchased from Invitrogen. The Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR) was used to detect the fluorescent signal.Quantification of A\u03b2 peptidesA\u03b2 peptides from the \u03b3-secretase assays described above were quantified by sandwich ELISA according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Three kits were used to detect human A\u03b21\u201340 (Invitrogen KHB3481) and A\u03b21\u201342 (Invitrogen KHB3544 and Wako 269-64401).Supporting Information Top Figure S1. Characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing human FAD-linked PS1 variants in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Presenilin double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Two clones per PS1 variant were selected for characterization. (A) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with various antibodies to detect the endogenous \u03b3-secretase core components: NCT (NCT164), hPS1 (NTF, MAB1563), and PEN2 (UD1), and with an antibody for APP (A8717). \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. (B) \u03b3-Secretase activity assays were performed with microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with lipids and 1 \u00b5M of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. * Indicates a non-specific band, which was not detected in microsomal protein extracts of the same cell lines using the same antibody (MAB1563) (B).

APP-CTF profiles in WT MEF, MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 and \u03b3 - PS1/2 transduced with the SPA4CT construct. WT MEF, MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 and \u03b3 - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]). Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717).(TIF)Figure S3. APH1 isoforms expressed in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Total RNAs were extracted from presenilin double-knockout MEFs, using standard procedures (Qiagen RNAeasy kit) and were quantified by spectrophotometry. One microgram of total RNAs was reverse transcribed for 1 h at 42\u00b0C by using the ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega) and oligo-dT primer in a final volume of 20 \u00b5L. PCR was next performed for each APH1 isoform on 1 \u00b5L of RT reaction by using the Roche PCR kit under standard conditions and the primers described in Table S1. The following cycling conditions were applied for all reactions: 94\u00b0C, 3 min; 30 cycles of [94\u00b0C, 30 s; 58\u00b0C, 30 s; 70\u00b0C, 40 s]; 70\u00b0C, 10 min. PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized using Alpha Innotech UV imager.(TIF)Table S1. Primers used to detect APH1 isoforms in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212.

Fraering*\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Brain Mind Institute, Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Alzheimer's Disease, Lausanne, SwitzerlandAbstract Top BackgroundMutations linked to early onset, familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are found most frequently in PSEN1, the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1). Together with nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the \u03b3-secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides. Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A\u03b2 production by enhancing the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain (AICD). Moreover, controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems, by either increasing A\u03b21\u201342 production, decreasing A\u03b21\u201340 production, or both. Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of \u03b3-secretase, we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT, APH1aL, PEN2, and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P, \u0394E9, or P436Q.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations. A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes. The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of \u03b3-secretase activity phenotype, in terms of A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro.Conclusion/SignificanceOur data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong \u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.Citation: Cacquevel M, Aeschbach L, Houacine J, Fraering PC (2012) Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified \u03b3-Secretase Complexes.

PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2, respectively, that constitute the catalytic core of \u03b3-secretase, the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional, Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases (I-CLiPs) [3]. Active \u03b3-secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin (NCT), the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and the presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2). Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue \u03b3-secretase inhibitors to PS1 [4], as well as the abolishment of \u03b3-secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [4], [5], [6], have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex.PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the \u03b3-secretase complex. The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [7], releasing their corresponding intracellular domains, which are capable of influencing gene expression. For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4, the \u03b3-secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function, whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3\u03b2 [8], the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established (see [9] for a review). The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by the successive actions of \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase, generating amyloid-beta peptides (A\u03b2) of different lengths, ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [10]. Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) by \u03b3-secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression, a major genetic determinant of AD, and in cholesterol metabolism [11]. In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate \u03b3-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].In a pathological context, 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD (www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations). It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A\u03b2 species, mainly A\u03b21\u201342, that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of the disease [15], [16]. Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Despite this growing consensus, the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A\u03b242, A\u03b240, and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations. On one hand, a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A\u03b242 production, accompanied or not with reduced A\u03b240 production, thereby leading to an increased A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio. On the other hand, reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [20]. Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A\u03b2 and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects. For example, endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis, as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A\u03b2 generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [23]. Next, it has been reported that \u03b3-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition (with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms, six combinations of \u03b3-secretase are possible), with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A\u03b2 species generated [24]. In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of \u03b3-secretase in cell-free systems, we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [25], [26], [27]. In particular, protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active \u03b3-secretase constituted of NCT, APH1aL, PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [26], [27] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 \u00c5 and 12 \u00c5 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [28], [29]. However, these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1. Here, we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human \u03b3-secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of \u03b3-secretase activity.Results Top Generation, selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutantsIn order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human \u03b3-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants, we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line that lacks the two presenilins (PS1/2\u2212/\u2212) [30], [31]. Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines, on a PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 background, that overexpress tagged versions of the three human \u03b3-secretase subunits NCT, APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1, and to purify the different human \u03b3-secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps. This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse \u03b3-secretase components. First, a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 (hNCT-V5), human APH1aL-HA (hAPH1aL-HA) and human Flag-PEN2 (Flag-hPEN2) into MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time. Next, the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected (designated \u03b3 - PS1/2) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants: PS1-WT, three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial, catalytic site aspartate residues (D257A, D385A, and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article), and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, \u0394E9 and P436Q, with mean disease onset at 24 years, 45.5 years and 28.3 years, respectively).For each PS1 variant, two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins, and extensively characterized (Figure 1). To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all \u03b3-sectease components from wild-type MEFs, they are collectively designated \u03b3-MEFs. As shown in Figure 1A, the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [23], [32]. As expected, and when compared to the parental \u03b3- PS1/2 cell line, higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones. In contrast to PEN2, APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line. Indeed, and as previously reported [23], [32], PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants, and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1. Interestingly, PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band, possibly reflecting a post-translational modification. Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones. First, and in sharp contrast to the other clones, those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 (PS1-FL; Figure 1A). As estimated by densitometry, the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87\u00b12% and 79\u00b17% of total PS1 (PS1-NTF+PS1-FL), respectively. Next, the PS1-\u0394E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments, as previously described [33], while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments, suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis.thumbnailFigure 1. Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human \u03b3-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5, Flag-hPEN2, hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line, designated as \u03b3- PS1/2, that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits. \u03b3- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Each clone, derived form the \u03b3- PS1/2, was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol \u03b3 and followed by the number of the clone (\u03b3-MEF) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF (WT MEF) and MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Two clones per \u03b3-secretase variant were selected for characterization. (A\u2013B) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 4\u201312% Bis-Tris or 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the \u03b3-secretase core components NCT (NCT164), PS1 (NTF, MAB1563; CTF; MAB5232), APH1aL-HA (3F10), and Flag-PEN2 (M2) (A), and endogenous APP (A8717) (B). \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. CTF: C-terminal fragment, FL: full-length, im.: immature NCT; m.: mature NCT, N: N-glycosylated, NTF: N-terminal fragment, O: O-glycosylated.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP. As expected, and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs (a common characteristic among known substrates in response to \u03b3-secretase pharmacological inhibition), the activity of \u03b3-secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental \u03b3 - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 (Figure 1B). In the clones expressing PS1-WT, APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high \u03b3-secretase activity, while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation. In PS1-\u0394E9 clones, a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed (Figure 1B). Although a poor recovery of \u03b3-secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1-\u0394E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [23], the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [34], [35]. Importantly, all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5, hAPH1aL-HA, Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other \u03b3-secretase components (cf. Figure S1A). These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the \u03b3-secretase.Next, we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A\u03b2 species. For this purpose, and as described elsewhere [36], we used an APP-based \u03b3-secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus (SPA4CT-Flag). This substrate was transduced in the above-described \u03b3-secretase overexpressing stable cell lines (\u03b3-MEFs) as well as in wild-type MEFs, and APP-CTFs and A\u03b2 levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media, respectively (Figure 2). Under these conditions, the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate, associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels (Figure 2A and Figure S2). As estimated by ELISA, a three-fold increase in A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase (\u03b3-MEF WT), in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs (Figure 2B). Also, the average A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were not significantly different in those cell lines (Mean \u00b1 SD: \u03b3-MEF WT#5: 0.30\u00b10.01; \u03b3-MEF WT#8: 0.29\u00b10.01; WT MEF: 0.19\u00b10.06). Next, overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in \u03b3-MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants (Figure 2C), and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A\u03b2 levels as measured by ELISA (Figure 2D). First, only traces of both A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were detected in \u03b3-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants. Next, \u03b3-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A\u03b2 levels when compared to the wild-type clones. Overall, the average A\u03b21\u201340 levels were decreased in these cell lines (Mean of two clones in pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 224.6\u00b10.1, L166P: 84.3\u00b134.2, \u0394E9: 167.2\u00b140.7, P436Q: 82.8\u00b174.7), while the A\u03b21\u201342 levels were increased (Mean of two clones in pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 69.9\u00b17.9, L166P: 310.7\u00b181.0, \u0394E9: 94.4\u00b118.5, P436Q: 141.1\u00b198.5). Consistent with previously reported data, the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were increased in all \u03b3-MEF clones overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations (Figure 2D) (Mean of two clones pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 0.31\u00b10.03, L166P: 3.8\u00b10.58, \u0394E9: 0.6\u00b10.03, P436Q: 2.0\u00b10.59).thumbnailFigure 2. A\u03b2 production in cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.WT MEF, \u03b3-MEF and \u03b3 - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus. Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717) (A, C). A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 levels were also measured in the corresponding cell culture media (B, D). Data corresponds to three independent experiments (Mean \u00b1 SEM).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified \u03b3-secretase complexesWe next assessed the activity of \u03b3-secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of \u03b3-MEFs. Membrane protein extracts were prepared and \u03b3-secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP, and referred to as C100-Flag (Figure 3A). The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry. As shown in Figure 3A, the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1-\u0394E9 clones accounted for 42\u00b11% and 13\u00b16% of that in the PS1-WT clones, respectively. AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants. Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other human \u03b3-secretase components (Figure S1B).thumbnailFigure 3. Enzymatic activity of partially purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) \u03b3-Secretase activity assays performed with \u03b3-MEF and \u03b3 - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with lipids and 1 \u00b5M of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions, reflecting \u03b3-secretase activity, were estimated by densitometry. PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. (B) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4\u00b0C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins, and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in (A). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for \u03b3-secretase subunits ((NCT164 (NCT), MAB1563 (PS1-NTF), or UD1 (PEN2)). AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody (A8717). *Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains. (C) A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL (left Y-axis) or in percentage (right Y-axis) of the mean of A\u03b21\u201340 levels generated by the two wild-type clones. A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios are indicated on the top of the bars. The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions. To do so, \u03b3-secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate. Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins (anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10, targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of \u03b3-secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions. As shown in Figure 3B, the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT, PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the \u03b3-secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used (Figures 3B). In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts (Figure 3A), those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation, when compared to PS1-WT (Figure 3B). Furthermore, levels of A\u03b21\u201340 produced from PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~6%, ~1.5% and ~0.5%, when compared to these produced from PS1-WT \u03b3-secretase. Following the same tendency, A\u03b21\u201342 levels generated from PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9 and PS1-P436Q \u03b3-secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~20%, ~5% and ~3% of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes. The A\u03b21-42/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio measured for WT \u03b3-MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data (compare Figures 2D and 3C), validating our in vitro experimental conditions. Interestingly, an overall A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio of ~1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants, with the exception of P436Q#4 (~2). However, in the latter, the ratio may have been overestimated because the A\u03b21\u201340 levels measured were at the detection limit. This similarity in the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios generated by the different mutants has, to the best of our knowledge, never been observed in previous studies.Highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotypeIn order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions, we purified to homogeneity \u03b3-secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1. The purification process (described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts. Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background, this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively \u03b3-secretase complexes made of human components. As highlighted in Figure 4B, our protocol led to the production of stable, high molecular weight \u03b3-secretase complexes (HMWCs) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native (BN)-PAGE of ~350 kDa, which is consistent with previous reports [26], [27], [37]. The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes (Figure 4B, upper panel), for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 (Figure 4B, lower panels). As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different \u03b3-secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates, it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar (Figure 4B), thus facilitating further comparative analyses. The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes (Figure 4C) confirmed the presence of all core components (NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, Flag-PEN2 and PS1) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1. Interestingly, the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified \u03b3-secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification (Figure 1A), indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations. To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect \u03b3-secretase activity in these purified complexes, we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate (Figure 3A) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes, immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity. As shown in Figure 5A, \u03b3-secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones. This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions (Figure 5A). Next, sandwich ELISAs directed against A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes. Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA, the production of both A\u03b2 species by \u03b3-secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants (Figure 5B). The A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio measured in PS1-WT \u03b3-secretase complexes (~0.22) was similar to that previously reported [26], [27], thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of \u03b3-secretase activity with this protocol. Together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P, \u0394E9, and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss (at least 90% as estimated by ELISA) of \u03b3-secretase activity.thumbnailFigure 4. High-grade purification of human \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) Schematic representation of the \u03b3-secretase purification process. Briefly, Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human \u03b3-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants. Next, these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods. (B) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified \u03b3-secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants. Equal volumes of the different purified \u03b3-secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4\u201316% Bis-Tris gel, and stained with silver nitrate (top panel), or immunostained for NCT (NCT164, middle panel) or PS1-NTF (ab10281, bottom panel) as indicated. \u03b3-Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes (HMWCs) of ~350 kDa. Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones. (C) Equal volumes of purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) and immunostained with anti-NCT (NCT164), anti-PS1-NTF (MAB1563), anti-PS1-CTF (MAB5232), anti-HA (3F10), or anti-Flag (M2) antibodies. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g004 thumbnailFigure 5. Enzymatic activity of highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants.Equal amounts of the different purified \u03b3-secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag, as described in Figure 3. The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody (M2) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag (A), and by sandwich ELISA for A\u03b21\u201340 or A\u03b21\u201342 (B). Note that the levels of A\u03b2 produced from FAD-linked \u03b3-secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards, close to the detection limit. Whenever possible, A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by \u03b3-secretase have been reported. First, it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A\u03b21\u201342 [15], [38]. Since A\u03b21\u201342, the first A\u03b2 specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [16], [39], is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A\u03b2 species [40], [41], [42], it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [43]. This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A\u03b2 accumulation and deposition in the brain [44], [45]. However, Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A\u03b2 production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [23]. These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo. By extension, we hypothesized that the other components of \u03b3-secretase, namely APH1, NCT and PEN2, may influence the mutant phenotype as well. Indeed, \u03b3-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2. Therefore, it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct \u03b3-secretase subtypes. This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A\u03b2 profiles. When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A\u03b2 species [24]. With this regard, it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [23] and employed here (cf. Figure S3). Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems, we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems, by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human \u03b3-secretase components. Under these conditions, the biochemical and functional properties of \u03b3-secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, \u0394E9, and P436Q), dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized. The activity of \u03b3-secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for \u03b3-secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5, APH1aL, Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [26], [27], that resulted in A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3. In contrast, we found a major loss in the activity of \u03b3-secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of \u03b3-secretase [5], [6], [32], the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected. Indeed, the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A\u03b21\u201342 levels both in vivo [46] and in vitro [20], in the presence of endogenous PS1, PS2 and APH1 components. In contrast, Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 production in a PS knockout background. These results are consistent with our in vitro data, although the reduction in A\u03b21\u201342 and A\u03b21\u201340 production was more pronounced in our system. However, they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A\u03b21\u201342 associated with a decrease in A\u03b21\u201340. Taken together, these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of \u03b3-secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations. Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use, in previously described cellular systems, of APP carrying the Swedish mutation (K670M/N671L) [20], [23], [46]. Initially, this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A\u03b2 species by favouring its \u03b2-secretase cleavage [47], [48]. However, Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the \u03b3-secretase cleavage [49]. In particular, these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A\u03b242, associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A\u03b2, compared with the wild-type APP. Therefore, one cannot exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants, as suggested earlier [50].As far as the PS1-\u0394E9 mutant is concerned, previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A\u03b240 levels associated with an increase in A\u03b242 levels [51], [52], or no changes in A\u03b240 levels despite increased A\u03b242 levels [53], or a decrease in both A\u03b2 species [23]. In the present study, A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342, as well as AICD levels generated from purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with PS1-\u0394E9 were close to the limit of detection, resulting in a loss of at least 95% of the \u03b3-secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1. Similarly, we found a near to complete loss of \u03b3-secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant (mean onset: 28.3 years) [54]. Consistent with a recent study [35], and in contrast to PS1-L166P, the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired. Interestingly, the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased \u03b3-secretase activity and A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells (~75% or ~50% of the control for A\u03b240 or A\u03b242, respectively), but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study (more than 97% for both A\u03b2 species).Overall, our data show that, under our experimental conditions, the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity (at least 90%) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified \u03b3-secretase complexes. This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A\u03b21\u201342 levels were relatively less affected than A\u03b21\u201340 levels. Interestingly, the ratio between the two A\u03b2 species was similar for the variants tested here (~1), suggesting a common modulatory mechanism. Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of \u03b3-secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio compared to PS1-WT, as previously observed in vivo [15], [38]. Taken together, the overall reduction in A\u03b2 levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions. Indeed, even if A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions, A\u03b2 production was strikingly different.One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of \u03b3-secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations. For instance, it remains unknown whether \u03b3-secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations. In support to that regard, Winkler and colleagues recently purified human \u03b3-secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes, containing both APH1a and AHP1b, led to increased A\u03b21\u201342 production associated with decreased A\u03b21\u201340 production, as compared to the PS1-WT complexes. Another possible explanation would be that purified \u03b3-secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates, due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins. These include TMP21 or the recently reported \u03b3-secretase activating protein (GSAP) [12], [13]. Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis.The loss of activity in \u03b3-secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD. As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes, including the neprilysin [55], and the lipoprotein receptor, LRP1 [11], it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo. For instance, it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A\u03b2 metabolism in return. In support to these views, Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants, albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [56]. They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone, suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions. These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [57]. Altogether, the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of \u03b3-secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD. They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting \u03b3-secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [58]. Supporting this view, the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, but actually made it worse [59].Collectively, our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A\u03b2 pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A\u03b2 species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by \u03b3-secretase substrates. This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease. Since it has been established that A\u03b2 and AICD are generated following the processing by \u03b3-secretase at two distinct gamma- and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [60], further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP, as well as in other known \u03b3-secretase substrates.Materials and Methods Top DNA Constructs and mutagenesisNCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA, wild-type PS1 human cDNAs (PS1-WT) were obtained from D. Selkoe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). PS1 \u0394E9 cDNA was obtained from C. Saura (Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Spain). PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A cDNAs were obtained from M. Wolfe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). Mutations in PSEN1, namely, L166P and P436Q, were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis on the plasmid pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)-PS1-WT using T7 or BGH primers (specific to the plasmid DNA sequence) together with the corresponding primers: L166P Rv: 5\u2032 CAG CAA CAA Taa gct tGA TAT AAT AGG 3\u2032; L166P Fw: 5\u2032 CTT ATT ATA TCa agc ttA TTG TTG CTG 3\u2032; P436Q Rv: 5\u2032 TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTC TTG AAA ATG GCA AGG AG 3\u2032; P436Q Fw: 5\u2032 TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTG CCA GCT CTT CAA ATC TCC 3\u2032. The sequences corresponding to enzyme restriction sites are given in small letters. The PCR fragments were next digested with BamHI/HindIII and HindIII/XhoI respectively, and were subcloned into pcDNA3. PS1 D257A/D385A (DDAA) was obtained by subcloning the DraI/XhoI digested fragment of PS1 D385A into pcDNA3.1-PS1 D257A. The APP based substrate SPA4CT-Flag, corresponding to the signal peptide of APP fused to the APP-C99-Flag with a small linker region (DA) [36], was obtained by removing the HindIII/EcoRI fragment of pcDNA3-APP695-Flag and inserting the following annealed primers: 5\u2032 AGC TTA TGC TGC CCG GTT TG GCA CTG CTC CTG CTG GCC GCC TGG ACG GCT CGG GCG GAT GCA GAT GCA G 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 AAT TCT GCA TCT GCA TCC GCC CGA GCC GTC CAG GCG GCC AGC AGG AGC AGT GCC AAA CCG GGC AGC ATA 3\u2032. All constructs were next subcloned into the self-inactivated vector pSIN-PGK-WHV cassette (a kind gift from R. Zufferey, Brain Mind Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland). Inserts for plasmids pET21-C100-Flag, and pET21-C100-His were generated by PCR as previously described [27]. Plasmids pMD2G and psPAX2 were obtained from D. Trono (Global Health Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland).Lentivector productionReplication-defective lentiviral particles were produced by a three-plasmid transient transfection of cells from the human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cell line [61]. Briefly, cells were incubated in 10 cm dishes until they reached 70% confluence and were transiently co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method, with 5 \u00b5g of envelope plasmid (pMD2G), 15 \u00b5g of packaging plasmid (psPAX2), and 20 \u00b5g of vector plasmids (pSIN-PGK-WHV). Cells were incubated overnight with DNA-calcium precipitates, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) and incubated with 7 mL of DMEM. After 24 h, the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled, passed through 0.45 \u00b5m filter, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C as 2 mL aliquots until use. A p24 ELISA (Zeptometrix corporation) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated.Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductionsMouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs, obtained from B. De Strooper, Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology, Belgium) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [30], [31] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen). A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors (LV) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage (1/20). Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection. The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins (designated \u03b3 - PS1/2) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants, by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT, PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9, PS1-P436Q, PS1-D257A, PS1-D385A, and PS1-DDAA. For each PS1 variant, five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for \u03b3-secretase purification. For SPA4CT overexpression experiments, 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM, 1% FBS, P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM, 2% FBS, P/S for 24 h. Finally, cell culture medium was harvested, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000\u00d7 rpm and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing. Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction.Protein extractionTotal protein extracts were prepared in 1% NP40 - HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000\u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7 g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).Multi-step purification of human \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1) Cell membrane preparation. MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells (1.0\u00d7109 cells) expressing NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1: wild type (WT), or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues, were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer (50 mM MES, pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Next, cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer (Emulsiflex-C5, Avestin Inc, ON Canada) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000\u00d7 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C in a SW32Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet. 2) Bicarbonate wash. The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 11.3) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times, and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. 3) Solubilisation of \u03b3-secretase complexes. The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times. The membranes were then incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant saved. This lysate is defined as \u201csolubilised \u03b3-secretase preparation\u201d. Next, these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of \u03b3-secretase complexes as described below. 4) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification. The solubilised \u03b3-secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer, and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) (final detergent concentration: 0.08% CHAPSO, 0.08% digitonin) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with agitation after adding 200 \u00b5L of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 \u00b5g/mL of Flag peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated \u201cM2 pooled 800 \u00b5L fractions\u201d. 5) Anti-V5 affinity purification. The M2 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1 mL with 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with 200 \u00b5L of anti-V5 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin-TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted for 1 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 500 \u00b5g/mL of V5 peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated 4 times, and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated \u201cV5 pooled 1.6 mL fractions\u201d. 6) Anti-HA affinity purification. As a final purification step, the V5 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1.8 mL with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with 200 \u00b5L of anti-HA affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted overnight at 4\u00b0C with 0.2 mL of this buffer containing 200 \u00b5g/mL of HA peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once, for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, and the two eluted fractions were kept separately, designated \u201cHA fraction E1\u201d and \u201cHA fraction E2\u201d.Co-immunoprecipitationCo-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts. Briefly, 100 \u00b5g of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche), and 50 \u00b5L of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. Samples were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer. Finally, beads were resuspended in 50 \u00b5L of 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro \u03b3-secretase assays.In vitro \u03b3-secretase activity assaysIn vitro \u03b3-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27]. \u03b3-Secretase APP-based substrates were expressed in E. coli transfected with plasmids pET21-C100-Flag or pET21-C100-His as a fusion protein consisting of a Met for translation initiation, and either the Flag tag sequence (C100-Flag) or the His tag sequence (C100-His), and were affinity purified using an anti-Flag resin (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) or an Ni-NTA agarose resin (Invitrogen), respectively. In vitro assays were performed at 37\u00b0C for 4 h, with 1 \u00b5M of recombinant substrate, 0.025% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and 0.1% phosphatidylcholine (PC). \u03b3-Secretase activity was quantified by measuring the amount of AICD and A\u03b2 generated during the reaction, by immunoblot or sandwich ELISA respectively, as described below.SDS-PAGE, Native PAGE, Western blotting and antibodiesTotal or microsomal protein extracts were resolved by electrophoresis on NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen) or on standard 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide Tris Glycine gels for SDS-PAGE analysis. Purified \u03b3-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE\u2122 Novex\u00ae Bis-Tris 4\u201316% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen). Silver staining was performed directly on gel according to manufacturer instructions (Biorad). For immunoblot analysis, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (Whatman), and probed with the following antibodies: anti-Nicastrin NCT164 (BD Bioscience), anti-V5-tag for NCT-V5 (Covance), MAB1563 (Millipore) or ab10281 (Abcam) for PS1 NTF, MAB5232 for PS1 CTF (Millipore), 3F10 for APH1aL-HA (Roche), anti-Flag M2 for Flag-PEN-2 or C100-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich), A8717 for APP CTF (Sigma-Aldrich), and A2066 for \u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Anti-mouse/rabbit/rat IgG conjugated to Alexa 680 were purchased from Invitrogen. The Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR) was used to detect the fluorescent signal.Quantification of A\u03b2 peptidesA\u03b2 peptides from the \u03b3-secretase assays described above were quantified by sandwich ELISA according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Three kits were used to detect human A\u03b21\u201340 (Invitrogen KHB3481) and A\u03b21\u201342 (Invitrogen KHB3544 and Wako 269-64401).Supporting Information Top Figure S1. Characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing human FAD-linked PS1 variants in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Presenilin double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Two clones per PS1 variant were selected for characterization. (A) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with various antibodies to detect the endogenous \u03b3-secretase core components: NCT (NCT164), hPS1 (NTF, MAB1563), and PEN2 (UD1), and with an antibody for APP (A8717). \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. (B) \u03b3-Secretase activity assays were performed with microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with lipids and 1 \u00b5M of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. * Indicates a non-specific band, which was not detected in microsomal protein extracts of the same cell lines using the same antibody (MAB1563) (B).

Fraering*\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Brain Mind Institute, Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Alzheimer's Disease, Lausanne, SwitzerlandAbstract Top BackgroundMutations linked to early onset, familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are found most frequently in PSEN1, the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1). Together with nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the \u03b3-secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides. Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A\u03b2 production by enhancing the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain (AICD). Moreover, controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems, by either increasing A\u03b21\u201342 production, decreasing A\u03b21\u201340 production, or both. Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of \u03b3-secretase, we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT, APH1aL, PEN2, and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P, \u0394E9, or P436Q.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations. A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes. The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of \u03b3-secretase activity phenotype, in terms of A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro.Conclusion/SignificanceOur data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong \u03b3-secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio, two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.Citation: Cacquevel M, Aeschbach L, Houacine J, Fraering PC (2012) Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified \u03b3-Secretase Complexes.

PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2, respectively, that constitute the catalytic core of \u03b3-secretase, the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional, Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases (I-CLiPs) [3]. Active \u03b3-secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin (NCT), the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and the presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2). Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue \u03b3-secretase inhibitors to PS1 [4], as well as the abolishment of \u03b3-secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [4], [5], [6], have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex.PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the \u03b3-secretase complex. The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [7], releasing their corresponding intracellular domains, which are capable of influencing gene expression. For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4, the \u03b3-secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function, whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3\u03b2 [8], the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established (see [9] for a review). The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by the successive actions of \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) and \u03b3-secretase, generating amyloid-beta peptides (A\u03b2) of different lengths, ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [10]. Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) by \u03b3-secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression, a major genetic determinant of AD, and in cholesterol metabolism [11]. In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate \u03b3-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].In a pathological context, 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD (www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations). It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A\u03b2 species, mainly A\u03b21\u201342, that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of the disease [15], [16]. Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Despite this growing consensus, the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A\u03b242, A\u03b240, and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations. On one hand, a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A\u03b242 production, accompanied or not with reduced A\u03b240 production, thereby leading to an increased A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio. On the other hand, reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [20]. Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A\u03b2 and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects. For example, endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis, as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A\u03b2 generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [23]. Next, it has been reported that \u03b3-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition (with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms, six combinations of \u03b3-secretase are possible), with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A\u03b2 species generated [24]. In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of \u03b3-secretase in cell-free systems, we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [25], [26], [27]. In particular, protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active \u03b3-secretase constituted of NCT, APH1aL, PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [26], [27] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 \u00c5 and 12 \u00c5 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [28], [29]. However, these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1. Here, we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human \u03b3-secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of \u03b3-secretase activity.Results Top Generation, selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutantsIn order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human \u03b3-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants, we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line that lacks the two presenilins (PS1/2\u2212/\u2212) [30], [31]. Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines, on a PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 background, that overexpress tagged versions of the three human \u03b3-secretase subunits NCT, APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1, and to purify the different human \u03b3-secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps. This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse \u03b3-secretase components. First, a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 (hNCT-V5), human APH1aL-HA (hAPH1aL-HA) and human Flag-PEN2 (Flag-hPEN2) into MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time. Next, the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected (designated \u03b3 - PS1/2) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants: PS1-WT, three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial, catalytic site aspartate residues (D257A, D385A, and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article), and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, \u0394E9 and P436Q, with mean disease onset at 24 years, 45.5 years and 28.3 years, respectively).For each PS1 variant, two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins, and extensively characterized (Figure 1). To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all \u03b3-sectease components from wild-type MEFs, they are collectively designated \u03b3-MEFs. As shown in Figure 1A, the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [23], [32]. As expected, and when compared to the parental \u03b3- PS1/2 cell line, higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones. In contrast to PEN2, APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line. Indeed, and as previously reported [23], [32], PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants, and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1. Interestingly, PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band, possibly reflecting a post-translational modification. Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones. First, and in sharp contrast to the other clones, those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 (PS1-FL; Figure 1A). As estimated by densitometry, the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87\u00b12% and 79\u00b17% of total PS1 (PS1-NTF+PS1-FL), respectively. Next, the PS1-\u0394E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments, as previously described [33], while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments, suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis.thumbnailFigure 1. Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human \u03b3-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5, Flag-hPEN2, hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line, designated as \u03b3- PS1/2, that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits. \u03b3- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Each clone, derived form the \u03b3- PS1/2, was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol \u03b3 and followed by the number of the clone (\u03b3-MEF) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF (WT MEF) and MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Two clones per \u03b3-secretase variant were selected for characterization. (A\u2013B) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 4\u201312% Bis-Tris or 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the \u03b3-secretase core components NCT (NCT164), PS1 (NTF, MAB1563; CTF; MAB5232), APH1aL-HA (3F10), and Flag-PEN2 (M2) (A), and endogenous APP (A8717) (B). \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. CTF: C-terminal fragment, FL: full-length, im.: immature NCT; m.: mature NCT, N: N-glycosylated, NTF: N-terminal fragment, O: O-glycosylated.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP. As expected, and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs (a common characteristic among known substrates in response to \u03b3-secretase pharmacological inhibition), the activity of \u03b3-secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental \u03b3 - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 (Figure 1B). In the clones expressing PS1-WT, APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high \u03b3-secretase activity, while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation. In PS1-\u0394E9 clones, a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed (Figure 1B). Although a poor recovery of \u03b3-secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1-\u0394E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [23], the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [34], [35]. Importantly, all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5, hAPH1aL-HA, Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other \u03b3-secretase components (cf. Figure S1A). These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the \u03b3-secretase.Next, we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A\u03b2 species. For this purpose, and as described elsewhere [36], we used an APP-based \u03b3-secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus (SPA4CT-Flag). This substrate was transduced in the above-described \u03b3-secretase overexpressing stable cell lines (\u03b3-MEFs) as well as in wild-type MEFs, and APP-CTFs and A\u03b2 levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media, respectively (Figure 2). Under these conditions, the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate, associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels (Figure 2A and Figure S2). As estimated by ELISA, a three-fold increase in A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase (\u03b3-MEF WT), in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs (Figure 2B). Also, the average A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were not significantly different in those cell lines (Mean \u00b1 SD: \u03b3-MEF WT#5: 0.30\u00b10.01; \u03b3-MEF WT#8: 0.29\u00b10.01; WT MEF: 0.19\u00b10.06). Next, overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in \u03b3-MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants (Figure 2C), and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A\u03b2 levels as measured by ELISA (Figure 2D). First, only traces of both A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were detected in \u03b3-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants. Next, \u03b3-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A\u03b2 levels when compared to the wild-type clones. Overall, the average A\u03b21\u201340 levels were decreased in these cell lines (Mean of two clones in pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 224.6\u00b10.1, L166P: 84.3\u00b134.2, \u0394E9: 167.2\u00b140.7, P436Q: 82.8\u00b174.7), while the A\u03b21\u201342 levels were increased (Mean of two clones in pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 69.9\u00b17.9, L166P: 310.7\u00b181.0, \u0394E9: 94.4\u00b118.5, P436Q: 141.1\u00b198.5). Consistent with previously reported data, the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were increased in all \u03b3-MEF clones overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations (Figure 2D) (Mean of two clones pg/mL \u00b1 SD: WT: 0.31\u00b10.03, L166P: 3.8\u00b10.58, \u0394E9: 0.6\u00b10.03, P436Q: 2.0\u00b10.59).thumbnailFigure 2. A\u03b2 production in cell lines overexpressing human \u03b3-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.WT MEF, \u03b3-MEF and \u03b3 - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus. Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717) (A, C). A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 levels were also measured in the corresponding cell culture media (B, D). Data corresponds to three independent experiments (Mean \u00b1 SEM).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified \u03b3-secretase complexesWe next assessed the activity of \u03b3-secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of \u03b3-MEFs. Membrane protein extracts were prepared and \u03b3-secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP, and referred to as C100-Flag (Figure 3A). The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry. As shown in Figure 3A, the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1-\u0394E9 clones accounted for 42\u00b11% and 13\u00b16% of that in the PS1-WT clones, respectively. AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants. Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other human \u03b3-secretase components (Figure S1B).thumbnailFigure 3. Enzymatic activity of partially purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) \u03b3-Secretase activity assays performed with \u03b3-MEF and \u03b3 - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with lipids and 1 \u00b5M of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions, reflecting \u03b3-secretase activity, were estimated by densitometry. PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. (B) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4\u00b0C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins, and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in (A). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for \u03b3-secretase subunits ((NCT164 (NCT), MAB1563 (PS1-NTF), or UD1 (PEN2)). AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody (A8717). *Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains. (C) A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL (left Y-axis) or in percentage (right Y-axis) of the mean of A\u03b21\u201340 levels generated by the two wild-type clones. A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios are indicated on the top of the bars. The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions. To do so, \u03b3-secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate. Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins (anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10, targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of \u03b3-secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions. As shown in Figure 3B, the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT, PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the \u03b3-secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used (Figures 3B). In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts (Figure 3A), those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation, when compared to PS1-WT (Figure 3B). Furthermore, levels of A\u03b21\u201340 produced from PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~6%, ~1.5% and ~0.5%, when compared to these produced from PS1-WT \u03b3-secretase. Following the same tendency, A\u03b21\u201342 levels generated from PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9 and PS1-P436Q \u03b3-secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~20%, ~5% and ~3% of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes. The A\u03b21-42/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio measured for WT \u03b3-MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data (compare Figures 2D and 3C), validating our in vitro experimental conditions. Interestingly, an overall A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio of ~1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants, with the exception of P436Q#4 (~2). However, in the latter, the ratio may have been overestimated because the A\u03b21\u201340 levels measured were at the detection limit. This similarity in the A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios generated by the different mutants has, to the best of our knowledge, never been observed in previous studies.Highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotypeIn order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions, we purified to homogeneity \u03b3-secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1. The purification process (described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts. Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background, this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively \u03b3-secretase complexes made of human components. As highlighted in Figure 4B, our protocol led to the production of stable, high molecular weight \u03b3-secretase complexes (HMWCs) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native (BN)-PAGE of ~350 kDa, which is consistent with previous reports [26], [27], [37]. The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes (Figure 4B, upper panel), for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 (Figure 4B, lower panels). As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different \u03b3-secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates, it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar (Figure 4B), thus facilitating further comparative analyses. The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes (Figure 4C) confirmed the presence of all core components (NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, Flag-PEN2 and PS1) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1. Interestingly, the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified \u03b3-secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification (Figure 1A), indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations. To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect \u03b3-secretase activity in these purified complexes, we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate (Figure 3A) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes, immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity. As shown in Figure 5A, \u03b3-secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones. This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions (Figure 5A). Next, sandwich ELISAs directed against A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes. Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA, the production of both A\u03b2 species by \u03b3-secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants (Figure 5B). The A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratio measured in PS1-WT \u03b3-secretase complexes (~0.22) was similar to that previously reported [26], [27], thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of \u03b3-secretase activity with this protocol. Together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P, \u0394E9, and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss (at least 90% as estimated by ELISA) of \u03b3-secretase activity.thumbnailFigure 4. High-grade purification of human \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) Schematic representation of the \u03b3-secretase purification process. Briefly, Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human \u03b3-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants. Next, these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods. (B) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified \u03b3-secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants. Equal volumes of the different purified \u03b3-secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4\u201316% Bis-Tris gel, and stained with silver nitrate (top panel), or immunostained for NCT (NCT164, middle panel) or PS1-NTF (ab10281, bottom panel) as indicated. \u03b3-Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes (HMWCs) of ~350 kDa. Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones. (C) Equal volumes of purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) and immunostained with anti-NCT (NCT164), anti-PS1-NTF (MAB1563), anti-PS1-CTF (MAB5232), anti-HA (3F10), or anti-Flag (M2) antibodies. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g004 thumbnailFigure 5. Enzymatic activity of highly purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants.Equal amounts of the different purified \u03b3-secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag, as described in Figure 3. The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody (M2) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag (A), and by sandwich ELISA for A\u03b21\u201340 or A\u03b21\u201342 (B). Note that the levels of A\u03b2 produced from FAD-linked \u03b3-secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards, close to the detection limit. Whenever possible, A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by \u03b3-secretase have been reported. First, it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A\u03b21\u201342 [15], [38]. Since A\u03b21\u201342, the first A\u03b2 specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [16], [39], is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A\u03b2 species [40], [41], [42], it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [43]. This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A\u03b2 accumulation and deposition in the brain [44], [45]. However, Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A\u03b2 production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [23]. These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo. By extension, we hypothesized that the other components of \u03b3-secretase, namely APH1, NCT and PEN2, may influence the mutant phenotype as well. Indeed, \u03b3-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2. Therefore, it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct \u03b3-secretase subtypes. This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A\u03b2 profiles. When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A\u03b2 species [24]. With this regard, it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [23] and employed here (cf. Figure S3). Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems, we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems, by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human \u03b3-secretase components. Under these conditions, the biochemical and functional properties of \u03b3-secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, \u0394E9, and P436Q), dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized. The activity of \u03b3-secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for \u03b3-secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5, APH1aL, Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [26], [27], that resulted in A\u03b21\u201342/A\u03b21\u201340 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3. In contrast, we found a major loss in the activity of \u03b3-secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of \u03b3-secretase [5], [6], [32], the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected. Indeed, the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A\u03b21\u201342 levels both in vivo [46] and in vitro [20], in the presence of endogenous PS1, PS2 and APH1 components. In contrast, Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342 production in a PS knockout background. These results are consistent with our in vitro data, although the reduction in A\u03b21\u201342 and A\u03b21\u201340 production was more pronounced in our system. However, they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A\u03b21\u201342 associated with a decrease in A\u03b21\u201340. Taken together, these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of \u03b3-secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations. Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use, in previously described cellular systems, of APP carrying the Swedish mutation (K670M/N671L) [20], [23], [46]. Initially, this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A\u03b2 species by favouring its \u03b2-secretase cleavage [47], [48]. However, Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the \u03b3-secretase cleavage [49]. In particular, these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A\u03b242, associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A\u03b2, compared with the wild-type APP. Therefore, one cannot exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants, as suggested earlier [50].As far as the PS1-\u0394E9 mutant is concerned, previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A\u03b240 levels associated with an increase in A\u03b242 levels [51], [52], or no changes in A\u03b240 levels despite increased A\u03b242 levels [53], or a decrease in both A\u03b2 species [23]. In the present study, A\u03b21\u201340, A\u03b21\u201342, as well as AICD levels generated from purified \u03b3-secretase complexes with PS1-\u0394E9 were close to the limit of detection, resulting in a loss of at least 95% of the \u03b3-secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1. Similarly, we found a near to complete loss of \u03b3-secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant (mean onset: 28.3 years) [54]. Consistent with a recent study [35], and in contrast to PS1-L166P, the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired. Interestingly, the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased \u03b3-secretase activity and A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells (~75% or ~50% of the control for A\u03b240 or A\u03b242, respectively), but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study (more than 97% for both A\u03b2 species).Overall, our data show that, under our experimental conditions, the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity (at least 90%) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified \u03b3-secretase complexes. This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A\u03b21\u201342 levels were relatively less affected than A\u03b21\u201340 levels. Interestingly, the ratio between the two A\u03b2 species was similar for the variants tested here (~1), suggesting a common modulatory mechanism. Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of \u03b3-secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio compared to PS1-WT, as previously observed in vivo [15], [38]. Taken together, the overall reduction in A\u03b2 levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions. Indeed, even if A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions, A\u03b2 production was strikingly different.One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of \u03b3-secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations. For instance, it remains unknown whether \u03b3-secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations. In support to that regard, Winkler and colleagues recently purified human \u03b3-secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes, containing both APH1a and AHP1b, led to increased A\u03b21\u201342 production associated with decreased A\u03b21\u201340 production, as compared to the PS1-WT complexes. Another possible explanation would be that purified \u03b3-secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates, due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins. These include TMP21 or the recently reported \u03b3-secretase activating protein (GSAP) [12], [13]. Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis.The loss of activity in \u03b3-secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD. As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes, including the neprilysin [55], and the lipoprotein receptor, LRP1 [11], it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo. For instance, it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A\u03b2 metabolism in return. In support to these views, Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants, albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [56]. They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone, suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions. These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [57]. Altogether, the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of \u03b3-secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD. They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting \u03b3-secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [58]. Supporting this view, the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, but actually made it worse [59].Collectively, our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A\u03b2 pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A\u03b2 species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by \u03b3-secretase substrates. This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease. Since it has been established that A\u03b2 and AICD are generated following the processing by \u03b3-secretase at two distinct gamma- and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [60], further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP, as well as in other known \u03b3-secretase substrates.Materials and Methods Top DNA Constructs and mutagenesisNCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA, wild-type PS1 human cDNAs (PS1-WT) were obtained from D. Selkoe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). PS1 \u0394E9 cDNA was obtained from C. Saura (Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Spain). PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A cDNAs were obtained from M. Wolfe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). Mutations in PSEN1, namely, L166P and P436Q, were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis on the plasmid pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)-PS1-WT using T7 or BGH primers (specific to the plasmid DNA sequence) together with the corresponding primers: L166P Rv: 5\u2032 CAG CAA CAA Taa gct tGA TAT AAT AGG 3\u2032; L166P Fw: 5\u2032 CTT ATT ATA TCa agc ttA TTG TTG CTG 3\u2032; P436Q Rv: 5\u2032 TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTC TTG AAA ATG GCA AGG AG 3\u2032; P436Q Fw: 5\u2032 TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTG CCA GCT CTT CAA ATC TCC 3\u2032. The sequences corresponding to enzyme restriction sites are given in small letters. The PCR fragments were next digested with BamHI/HindIII and HindIII/XhoI respectively, and were subcloned into pcDNA3. PS1 D257A/D385A (DDAA) was obtained by subcloning the DraI/XhoI digested fragment of PS1 D385A into pcDNA3.1-PS1 D257A. The APP based substrate SPA4CT-Flag, corresponding to the signal peptide of APP fused to the APP-C99-Flag with a small linker region (DA) [36], was obtained by removing the HindIII/EcoRI fragment of pcDNA3-APP695-Flag and inserting the following annealed primers: 5\u2032 AGC TTA TGC TGC CCG GTT TG GCA CTG CTC CTG CTG GCC GCC TGG ACG GCT CGG GCG GAT GCA GAT GCA G 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 AAT TCT GCA TCT GCA TCC GCC CGA GCC GTC CAG GCG GCC AGC AGG AGC AGT GCC AAA CCG GGC AGC ATA 3\u2032. All constructs were next subcloned into the self-inactivated vector pSIN-PGK-WHV cassette (a kind gift from R. Zufferey, Brain Mind Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland). Inserts for plasmids pET21-C100-Flag, and pET21-C100-His were generated by PCR as previously described [27]. Plasmids pMD2G and psPAX2 were obtained from D. Trono (Global Health Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland).Lentivector productionReplication-defective lentiviral particles were produced by a three-plasmid transient transfection of cells from the human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cell line [61]. Briefly, cells were incubated in 10 cm dishes until they reached 70% confluence and were transiently co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method, with 5 \u00b5g of envelope plasmid (pMD2G), 15 \u00b5g of packaging plasmid (psPAX2), and 20 \u00b5g of vector plasmids (pSIN-PGK-WHV). Cells were incubated overnight with DNA-calcium precipitates, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) and incubated with 7 mL of DMEM. After 24 h, the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled, passed through 0.45 \u00b5m filter, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C as 2 mL aliquots until use. A p24 ELISA (Zeptometrix corporation) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated.Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductionsMouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs, obtained from B. De Strooper, Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology, Belgium) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [30], [31] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen). A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors (LV) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage (1/20). Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection. The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins (designated \u03b3 - PS1/2) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants, by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT, PS1-L166P, PS1-\u0394E9, PS1-P436Q, PS1-D257A, PS1-D385A, and PS1-DDAA. For each PS1 variant, five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for \u03b3-secretase purification. For SPA4CT overexpression experiments, 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM, 1% FBS, P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM, 2% FBS, P/S for 24 h. Finally, cell culture medium was harvested, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000\u00d7 rpm and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing. Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction.Protein extractionTotal protein extracts were prepared in 1% NP40 - HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000\u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7 g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).Multi-step purification of human \u03b3-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1) Cell membrane preparation. MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells (1.0\u00d7109 cells) expressing NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1: wild type (WT), or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues, were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer (50 mM MES, pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Next, cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer (Emulsiflex-C5, Avestin Inc, ON Canada) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000\u00d7 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C in a SW32Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet. 2) Bicarbonate wash. The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 11.3) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times, and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. 3) Solubilisation of \u03b3-secretase complexes. The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times. The membranes were then incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant saved. This lysate is defined as \u201csolubilised \u03b3-secretase preparation\u201d. Next, these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of \u03b3-secretase complexes as described below. 4) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification. The solubilised \u03b3-secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer, and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) (final detergent concentration: 0.08% CHAPSO, 0.08% digitonin) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with agitation after adding 200 \u00b5L of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 \u00b5g/mL of Flag peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated \u201cM2 pooled 800 \u00b5L fractions\u201d. 5) Anti-V5 affinity purification. The M2 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1 mL with 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with 200 \u00b5L of anti-V5 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin-TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted for 1 h at 4\u00b0C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 500 \u00b5g/mL of V5 peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated 4 times, and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated \u201cV5 pooled 1.6 mL fractions\u201d. 6) Anti-HA affinity purification. As a final purification step, the V5 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1.8 mL with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with 200 \u00b5L of anti-HA affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted overnight at 4\u00b0C with 0.2 mL of this buffer containing 200 \u00b5g/mL of HA peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once, for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, and the two eluted fractions were kept separately, designated \u201cHA fraction E1\u201d and \u201cHA fraction E2\u201d.Co-immunoprecipitationCo-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts. Briefly, 100 \u00b5g of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche), and 50 \u00b5L of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. Samples were next incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer. Finally, beads were resuspended in 50 \u00b5L of 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro \u03b3-secretase assays.In vitro \u03b3-secretase activity assaysIn vitro \u03b3-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27]. \u03b3-Secretase APP-based substrates were expressed in E. coli transfected with plasmids pET21-C100-Flag or pET21-C100-His as a fusion protein consisting of a Met for translation initiation, and either the Flag tag sequence (C100-Flag) or the His tag sequence (C100-His), and were affinity purified using an anti-Flag resin (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) or an Ni-NTA agarose resin (Invitrogen), respectively. In vitro assays were performed at 37\u00b0C for 4 h, with 1 \u00b5M of recombinant substrate, 0.025% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and 0.1% phosphatidylcholine (PC). \u03b3-Secretase activity was quantified by measuring the amount of AICD and A\u03b2 generated during the reaction, by immunoblot or sandwich ELISA respectively, as described below.SDS-PAGE, Native PAGE, Western blotting and antibodiesTotal or microsomal protein extracts were resolved by electrophoresis on NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen) or on standard 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide Tris Glycine gels for SDS-PAGE analysis. Purified \u03b3-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE\u2122 Novex\u00ae Bis-Tris 4\u201316% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen). Silver staining was performed directly on gel according to manufacturer instructions (Biorad). For immunoblot analysis, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (Whatman), and probed with the following antibodies: anti-Nicastrin NCT164 (BD Bioscience), anti-V5-tag for NCT-V5 (Covance), MAB1563 (Millipore) or ab10281 (Abcam) for PS1 NTF, MAB5232 for PS1 CTF (Millipore), 3F10 for APH1aL-HA (Roche), anti-Flag M2 for Flag-PEN-2 or C100-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich), A8717 for APP CTF (Sigma-Aldrich), and A2066 for \u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Anti-mouse/rabbit/rat IgG conjugated to Alexa 680 were purchased from Invitrogen. The Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR) was used to detect the fluorescent signal.Quantification of A\u03b2 peptidesA\u03b2 peptides from the \u03b3-secretase assays described above were quantified by sandwich ELISA according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Three kits were used to detect human A\u03b21\u201340 (Invitrogen KHB3481) and A\u03b21\u201342 (Invitrogen KHB3544 and Wako 269-64401).Supporting Information Top Figure S1. Characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing human FAD-linked PS1 variants in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Presenilin double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Two clones per PS1 variant were selected for characterization. (A) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with various antibodies to detect the endogenous \u03b3-secretase core components: NCT (NCT164), hPS1 (NTF, MAB1563), and PEN2 (UD1), and with an antibody for APP (A8717). \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. (B) \u03b3-Secretase activity assays were performed with microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with lipids and 1 \u00b5M of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. * Indicates a non-specific band, which was not detected in microsomal protein extracts of the same cell lines using the same antibody (MAB1563) (B).

WT MEF, MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212 and \u03b3 - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]). Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717).(TIF)Figure S3. APH1 isoforms expressed in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212. Total RNAs were extracted from presenilin double-knockout MEFs, using standard procedures (Qiagen RNAeasy kit) and were quantified by spectrophotometry. One microgram of total RNAs was reverse transcribed for 1 h at 42\u00b0C by using the ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega) and oligo-dT primer in a final volume of 20 \u00b5L. PCR was next performed for each APH1 isoform on 1 \u00b5L of RT reaction by using the Roche PCR kit under standard conditions and the primers described in Table S1. The following cycling conditions were applied for all reactions: 94\u00b0C, 3 min; 30 cycles of [94\u00b0C, 30 s; 58\u00b0C, 30 s; 70\u00b0C, 40 s]; 70\u00b0C, 10 min. PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized using Alpha Innotech UV imager.(TIF)Table S1. Primers used to detect APH1 isoforms in MEF PS1/2\u2212/\u2212.

First published December 3, 2012Received for publication April 26, 2012, and accepted in revised form September 27, 2012.Deposition of amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) to form neuritic plaques in the brain is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). A\u03b2 is generated from sequential cleavages of the \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases, and \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the \u03b2-secretase essential for A\u03b2 generation. Previous studies have indicated that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) may play a role in APP processing by modulating \u03b3-secretase activity, thereby facilitating A\u03b2 production. There are two highly conserved isoforms of GSK3: GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2. We now report that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production by decreasing BACE1 gene transcription and expression. The regulation of BACE1 gene expression by GSK3\u03b2 was dependent on NF-\u03baB signaling. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling markedly reduced A\u03b2 deposition and neuritic plaque formation, and rescued memory deficits in the double transgenic AD model mice. These data provide evidence for regulation of BACE1 expression and AD pathogenesis by GSK3\u03b2 and that inhibition of GSK3 signaling can reduce A\u03b2 neuropathology and alleviate memory deficits in AD model mice. Our study suggests that interventions that specifically target the \u03b2-isoform of GSK3 may be a safe and effective approach for treating AD. IntroductionAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia. The characteristic neuropathological features of AD include neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2), the central component of neuritic plaques, is produced from sequential endoproteolytic cleavages of the type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase. Proteolytic processing of APP at the \u03b2 site is essential for generating A\u03b2, and \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the \u03b2-secretase in vivo (1\u20134). BACE1 cleaves APP at two \u03b2-sites, Asp+1 and Glu+11 of the A\u03b2 domain, to generate C99 and C89 fragment, respectively (5). Subsequently, \u03b3-secretase cleaves C99 within its transmembrane domain to release A\u03b2 and APP C-terminal fragment \u03b3 (CTF\u03b3). In addition to APP, BACE1 substrates also include other proteins: LRP (6), APLP1 (7), APLP2 (8), ST6Gal I (9), and PSGL-1 (10). BACE1 expression is tightly regulated at the level of transcription (5, 11, 12) and translation (13\u201316). It was reported that a G/C polymorphism in exon 5 of the BACE1 gene might be associated with some sporadic cases of AD (17\u201319). Although genetic analyses from our and other laboratories have failed to uncover any mutation in the BACE1 coding sequence or any disease-associated SNP in its promoter region in AD patients (20\u201322), increased \u03b2-secretase levels and activity have been reported in AD (23\u201327). BACE1 levels were elevated in neurons around plaques (28). BACE1 mRNA levels tended to increase as miR-107 levels decreased in the progression of AD (29). We reported that hypoxia, a common vascular component among AD risk factors, increased BACE1 expression, resulting in both increased A\u03b2 deposition and memory deficits in AD transgenic mice (30). Recently we found that both NF-\u03baB and BACE1 levels were increased in sporadic AD patients, and NF-\u03baB facilitated BACE1 gene expression and APP processing (27). Thus, increased BACE1 expression by NF-\u03baB signaling in the brain could be one of the mechanisms underlying AD development (27). Together, these studies indicate that BACE1 dysregulation plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. BACE1 has been considered as one of the major targets for AD drug development. Bace1-knockout mice have abolished A\u03b2 generation (31\u201333). Suppression of BACE1 by RNA interference reduced APP processing and A\u03b2 production in primary cortical neurons derived from both wild-type and Swedish APP mutant transgenic mice (34), and disruption of the Bace1 gene rescued memory deficits and cholinergic dysfunction in Swedish APP mice (35). Oral administration of a potent and selective BACE1 inhibitor decreased \u03b2-cleavage and A\u03b2 production in APP transgenic mice in vivo (36). Bace1-KO mice were reported to display hypomyelination of peripheral nerves and aberrant axonal segregation (37, 38), suggesting that inhibiting \u03b2-secretase may have unwanted collateral effects. However, even a partial reduction in BACE1 can have dramatically beneficial effects on AD pathology (39), suggesting that therapeutic inhibition of BACE1 is a valid therapeutic target for AD treatment. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinase originally identified as playing an important role in glycogen metabolism. Since its discovery, many studies have shown that GSK3 has pleiotropic functions, including embryonic development, gene transcription, and neuronal cell function (40). In mammals, two GSK3 isoforms are encoded by distinct genes: GSK3A produces a 51-kDa GSK3\u03b1 protein and GSK3B a 47-kDa GSK3\u03b2 protein (41). These two isoforms are highly homologous, sharing greater than 95% amino acid identity in the catalytic domains. Although both isoforms are ubiquitously expressed, the \u03b2 isoform is expressed at higher levels in neuronal tissues (42). GSK3 activity is regulated at several levels. Phosphorylation of Tyr279/Tyr216 on GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 is important for enzymatic activity (43). Inactivation of GSK3 can be achieved through phosphorylation of Ser21/Ser9 residues within the N-terminal domain on GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2, respectively. Stimulation of tissues by insulin and growth factors activates the PI3K/PKB/Akt signal transduction cascade, leading to phosphorylation of these inhibitory serine residues (44, 45). GSK3 is also regulated upon interaction of the Wnt ligand and its receptor Frizzled and co-receptor LRP5/6. This interaction releases GSK3 from a multi-protein complex formed by \u03b2-catenin, axin, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (46, 47), which prevents GSK3-mediated \u03b2-catenin degradation and induces \u03b2-catenin\u2013dependent gene transcription. Dysregulation of GSK3 activity has been implicated in AD. Increased GSK3\u03b2 activity was found in postmortem AD brains (48). GSK3\u03b2 has been found to phosphorylate the tau protein on various conserved sites and contribute to tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation (49, 50). GSK3\u03b1 was reported to regulate A\u03b2 production by positively modulating the \u03b3-secretase complex (51), although this finding has recently been challenged (52). Inhibition of GSK3 activity with the commonly known GSK3 inhibitors LiCl and valproic acid in cell culture (53) and animal models of AD decreased A\u03b2 production (51, 54). Although LiCl and valproic acid are known to inhibit GSK3 activity, these compounds also activate a plethora of signaling cascades that could differentially regulate APP processing independent of GSK3 (55\u201358). In this study, we examined the effects of GSK3\u03b2-specific inhibition on AD neuropathology and behavioral deficits and identified its underlying mechanism. We found that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP. Treatment with the GSK3 inhibitor AR-A014418 (ARA) reduced neuritic plaque formation and alleviated memory deficits in AD transgenic model mice. Furthermore, we found that GSK3\u03b2 regulated BACE1 transcription via NF-\u03baB signaling. Our work provides evidence that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 may be an effective therapeutic approach for treating AD. ResultsRegulation of \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production by GSK3 signaling. Previous studies showed that LiCl and valproic acid modulated GSK3 signaling and reduced A\u03b2 production (51, 54). However, the underlying mechanism is not well defined, and these compounds also have many confounding GSK3-independent effects. To examine the specific effect of GSK3 signaling on APP processing, we applied ARA, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of GSK3, to 20E2 cells, a stable cell line expressing human Swedish mutant APP (5). ARA at 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM significantly decreased the levels of the \u03b2-secretase cleavage product APP C99 to 95.7% \u00b1 1.6%, 66.4% \u00b1 0.7%, and 31.3% \u00b1 0.4%, respectively (P < 0.001 by 1-way ANOVA) (Figure 1A and B). The treatment had no significant effect on APP expression (Figure 1A). The A\u03b2 ELISA was performed to assess the levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 in the conditioned media of 20E2 cells. ARA markedly reduced A\u03b2 generation in a dose-dependent manner. A\u03b240 was decreased to 99.2% \u00b1 3.8%, 73.2% \u00b1 4.6%, and 48.7% \u00b1 1.3% with 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM of ARA treatment, respectively (P < 0.05) (Figure 1C); and A\u03b242 was reduced to 99.2% \u00b1 3.1%, 73.2% \u00b1 3.5%, and 48.7% \u00b1 4.5% with 1, 2.5 and 5 \u03bcM of ARA treatment, respectively (P < 0.01 by 1-way ANOVA) (Figure 1D). As expected, inhibition of GSK3 stabilized \u03b2-catenin (Figure 1A), and ARA treatment resulted in a significant increase in \u03b2-catenin levels to 152.7% \u00b1 11.1%, 221.3% \u00b1 17.0%, and 233.7% \u00b1 25.0% with 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM, respectively (P < 0.05). These data indicate that specifically inhibiting GSK3 reduced BACE1-mediated APP processing and C99 and A\u03b2 production. Specific inhibition of GSK3 reduces BACE1 cleavage of APP.Figure 1Specific inhibition of GSK3 reduces BACE1 cleavage of APP. (A) Swedish mutant APP stable cell line 20E2 was cultured and treated with ARA for 24 hours, and cell lysates subjected to Western blot analysis. Full-length APP and the APP CTFs were detected with C20 antibody. \u03b2-Catenin was detected by anti\u2013\u03b2-catenin antibody. \u03b2-Actin was detected by anti-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control.

(F) Quantification of C99 levels. n = 6; *P < 0.05, ANOVA. To further examine the effect of GSK3 on \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production, we pharmacologically blocked \u03b3-secretase activity with the \u03b3-secretase\u2013specific inhibitor L658,458 in 20E2 cells while co-treating with the GSK3 inhibitor ARA and G2. G2 is another structurally distinct GSK3 inhibitor, with an IC50 of 304 nM (59). As expected, \u03b3-secretase inhibition resulted in markedly increased generation of the APP CTFs C83 and C99 (Figure 1E). Addition of ARA or G2 reduced C99 levels to 78.2% \u00b1 1.1% and 63.9% \u00b1 6.6% (Figure 1, E and F). ARA treatment had no significant effect on Notch cleavage (Supplemental Figure 1B; supplemental material available online with this article; doi: 10.1172/JCI64516DS1). These data demonstrated that specific inhibition of GSK3 reduced \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP to generate C99 and A\u03b2 production in cells. GSK3\u03b2 but not GSK3\u03b1 regulates BACE1 gene expression and BACE1-mediated APP processing. Our study has shown that GSK3 regulated \u03b2-secretase processing of APP, an essential step for A\u03b2 generation. Since BACE1 is the \u03b2-secretase in vivo, we first examined whether GSK3 affects BACE1 gene expression. GSK3 has two highly homologous isoforms, GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2. We used RNA interference to specifically knock down the expression of GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 isoforms in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to determine whether both isoforms or one of the isoforms play a major role in regulating BACE1 gene expression. Specific knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 expression by the siRNA significantly reduced BACE1 mRNA levels to 76.0% \u00b1 6.6% as compared with control (P < 0.05) (Figure 2, A and B), whereas knockdown of GSK3\u03b1 did not affect BACE1 mRNA expression (P > 0.05) (Figure 2, A and B). Additional exogenous expression of GSK3\u03b2 rescued the reduction of BACE1 expression resulting from knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 by siRNA (Supplemental Figure 2). To examine whether specific knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 expression also affected \u03b2-secretase processing of APP, we transfected siRNA specific to GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 into 20E2 cells while inhibiting \u03b3-secretase activity with L658,458. Western blotting showed that GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 siRNA specifically reduced GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 expression, respectively (Figure 2C). Knockdown of GSK3\u03b1 expression did not significantly affect BACE1-mediated APP processing, whereas GSK3\u03b2 knockdown reduced the production of the BACE1 cleavage product C99 to 51.9% \u00b1 6.4% (P < 0.05) (Figure 2, C and D). GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, regulates BACE1 gene expression and APP processing.Figure 2GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, regulates BACE1 gene expression and APP processing. (A) SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were transfected with scrambled GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 isoform\u2013specific siRNA. RNA was extracted, and semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed to measure endogenous human BACE1, GSK3A, GSK3B, and \u03b2-actin mRNA levels with specific primers recognizing the coding sequence of each gene. PCR products after 28 cycles were analyzed on 1.2% agarose gel. (B) Endogenous BACE1 mRNA was significantly reduced with GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, isoform\u2013specific knockdown. The values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 3; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. (C) 20E2 cells were transfected with scrambled or GSK3\u03b1, or GSK3\u03b2 isoform\u2013specific siRNA while cotreated with L685,458 to block \u03b3-secretase activity. Full-length APP and CTF fragments were detected with C20 antibody. GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 were detected using a monoclonal GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 antibody. GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 isoforms were selectively reduced by the isoform-specific siRNA. \u03b2-Actin served as an internal control and was detected using a monoclonal anti\u2013\u03b2-actin antibody, AC-15. (D) GSK3\u03b2-specific knockdown significantly reduced C99 levels. GSK3\u03b1-specific knockdown did not have any significant effect. The values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. (E) Tetracycline-regulated SHSY5Y cells were induced to express constitutively active S9A-GSK3\u03b2. Endogenous human BACE1 mRNA levels were assessed as described above. Tetracyline-induced S9A-GSK3\u03b2 significantly increased BACE1 expression. (F) Quantification of the endogenous BACE1 mRNA level. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. To further confirm that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene expression at the transcription level, we assayed BACE1 mRNA in the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 inducible SHSY5Y stable cell line. This stable cell line carries the constitutively active mutant GSK3\u03b2, and expression of the mutant gene is under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (60). Addition of tetracycline induced the expression of active GSK3\u03b2 (Figure 2E) and resulted in significantly increased expression of BACE1 to 251.1% \u00b1 70.0% relative to the control (P < 0.05) (Figure 2F). These data demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, specifically regulates BACE1 gene expression and contribute to APP processing. GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene promoter activity. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 gene expression at the transcription level, we performed a BACE1 gene promoter assay. Two human BACE1 gene promoter deletion plasmids were constructed. Regions of the BACE1 promoter from \u20132890 to +292 bp (pB1-A) and from \u20139 to +292 bp (pB1-B) were inserted into promoterless vector pGL3-basic upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Figure 3A). To examine the effect of GSK3 on BACE1 gene promoter activity, we transfected N2a cells with pB1-A and then treated them with ARA. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling by ARA significantly decreased the promoter activity of pB1-A in N2a cells to 54.9% \u00b1 6.2% (P < 0.005) (Figure 3B). To further investigate the underlying mechanism and determine the BACE1 promoter region that mediates the transcriptional activation by GSK3 signaling, we co-transfected N2a cells with either pB1-A or pB1-B plasmid together with the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 plasmid, which carries a constitutively active form of GSK3\u03b2. Expression of active GSK3\u03b2 markedly increased the luciferase activity of pB1-A in the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 transfected cells to 144.0% \u00b1 2.0% as compared with the control (P < 0.05), but had no significant effect on the luciferase activity of pB1-B (P > 0.05) (Figure 3C). This result showed that enhancing GSK3\u03b2 signaling upregulated BACE1 gene promoter activity and the 2.8-kb promoter region is responsible for GSK3\u03b2-mediated upregulation of BACE1 transcription. To further confirm this finding, we transfected these two deletion promoter plasmids into Gsk3b-KO or wild-type cells. Ablation of Gsk3b expression in the Gsk3b-KO cells resulted in significant reduction in luciferase activity of pB1-A to 47.0% \u00b1 7.5% as compared with the wild-type control cells (P < 0.01) (Figure 3D). However, knockout of the Gsk3b gene had no significant effect on the luciferase activity of pB1-B (Figure 3D). Taken together, these results demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene expression via its effect on the BACE1 promoter. GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 promoter activation.Figure 3GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 promoter activation. (A) Schematic of the 3.3-kb (pB1-A) and 300-bp (pB1-B) human BACE1 promoter/luciferase construct. (B) The 3.5-kb human BACE1 promoter was transfected into N2a cells and treated with 5 \u03bcM ARA. GSK3 inhibition with ARA treatment resulted in a significant decrease in luciferase activity. (C) N2a cells were co-transfected with either promoter constructs and S9A-GSK3\u03b2 or a vector control. S9A-GSK3\u03b2 significantly increased the luciferase activity of the 3.3-kb BACE1 promoter construct but did not have any effect on the 300-bp promoter construct. (D) pB1-A or pB1-B constructs were transfected into Gsk3b-KO MEFs. pB1-A had significantly reduced promoter activity. All promoter data shown represent an average of at least 4 independent experiments, with each condition performed in triplicate. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005, Student\u2019s t test. NF-\u03baB mediates the transcriptional regulation of BACE1 gene expression by GSK3\u03b2. Recently we reported that levels of both BACE1 and NF-\u03baB are increased in AD brains, and NF-\u03baB signaling upregulates human BACE1 gene expression by acting on the cis-acting p65-binding element in its promoter (27). Previous studies in Gsk3b-KO mice demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2 is required for proper activation of NF-\u03baB (61). As our data indicate that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene transcription, we next examined whether regulation of BACE1 transcription by GSK3\u03b2 signaling is dependent on NF-\u03baB. TNF-\u03b1 is a strong activator of NF-\u03baB p65 expression. In order to examine the specific role of NF-\u03baB in GSK3\u03b2-regulated BACE1 transcription, we transfected N2a cells with a pBACE1-4\u03baB promoter plasmid that contained only the NF-\u03baB\u2013binding elements in the human BACE1 promoter (27). After transfection, the cells were cotreated with TNF-\u03b1 and the GSK3 inhibitor ARA. ARA treatment alone consistently reduced BACE1 promoter activity (Figure 4A). TNF-\u03b1 stimulation increased pB1A promoter activity to 132.6% \u00b1 7.5% of the control (P < 0.01). However, ARA treatment reduced the TNF-\u03b1\u2013induced BACE1 promoter activation to 115.6 \u00b1 6.9% as compared with TNF-\u03b1 treatment alone (P < 0.05) (Figure 4A). Overexpression of p65 NF-\u03baB significantly increased the BACE1 promoter activity to 487.1% \u00b1 102.2% as compared with the control (P < 0.001) (Figure 3D). However, ARA did not affect NF-\u03baB p65\u2019s upregulating effect on BACE1 promoter activity (P > 0.05), indicating that GSK3 signaling may have its effect upstream of NF-\u03baB in the modulation of BACE1 transcription (Figure 4B). To further confirm ARA\u2019s effect on NF-\u03baB activity, we co-transfected N2a cells with pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc and NF-\u03baB p65 or an empty vector, followed by treatment with ARA to inhibit GSK3 signaling. ARA reduced pNF-\u03baB-Luc promoter activity to 51.9% \u00b1 9.1% as compared with control (P < 0.05) (Figure 4C). Overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 significantly increased pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc promoter activity to 203.36 \u00b1 87.38\u2013fold (P < 0.001) (Figure 4C). Additional ARA treatment did not have any significant effect on the transcriptional activation of pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc by NF-\u03baB p65 overexpression (P > 0.05) (Figure 4C). These data indicate that the p65-binding elements in the BACE1 promoter mediated the effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 transcription. GSK3\u03b2 regulation of BACE1 transcription is dependent on NF-\u03baB p65 expressioFigure 4GSK3\u03b2 regulation of BACE1 transcription is dependent on NF-\u03baB p65 expression. (A) pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB plasmid contains the 4 NF-\u03baB cis-elements from the human BACE1 promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. N2a cells were co-transfected with pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB and pCMV-RLuc. Transfected cells were treated with vehicle solution (control) or 10 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 with/without 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours. (B) N2a cells were co-transfected with pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB plasmid and pMTF-p65 or a vector control. Transfected cells were then treated with a vehicle solution or 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours. (C) pNF-\u03baB-Luc was co-transfected with pMTF-p65 or a vector control and treated with a vehicle solution or 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours. Renilla luciferase was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, Student\u2019s t test. (D) Wild-type MEFs and RelA-KO MEFs which are dysfunctional for NF-\u03baB activity, were co-transfected with a 3.5-kb human BACE1 promoter and S9A-GSK3\u03b2 or a control vector. S9A-GSK3\u03b2 overexpression in MEFs. significantly increased luciferase activity (*P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test), whereas RelA-KO MEFs did not have any significant effect. Luciferase activity is indicative of BACE1 promoter activity. All promoter data shown represent an average of at least 4 independent experiments, with each condition performed in triplicate. (E) N2a cells were treated with 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours, followed by cell fractionation. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. ARA treatment significantly reduced NF-\u03baB p65 levels in the (F) nuclear fraction (n = 6; **P < 0.001, Student\u2019s t test) and (G) cytosolic fraction. n = 6; ***P < 0.001, Student\u2019s t test. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. To confirm the role of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in GSK3\u03b2-mediated BACE1 transcription, we transfected NF-\u03baB p65 knockout RelA-KO cells and wild-type control cells with the BACE1 promoter pB1-A and the constitutively active GSK3\u03b2 expression plasmid S9A-GSK3\u03b2. In wild-type cells, activation of GSK3\u03b2 signaling by expression of S9A-GSK3\u03b2 markedly increased BACE1 promoter activity to 189.6% \u00b1 20.9% as compared with the vector control (P < 0.05), whereas activation of GSK3\u03b2 signaling by expression of S9A-GSK3\u03b2 had no effect on BACE1 promoter activity in RelA-KO cells (P > 0.05) (Figure 4D), indicating that disruption of NF-\u03baB p65 expression in RelA-KO cells abolished GSK3\u03b2\u2019s effect on the transcriptional activation of the human BACE1 gene promoter. To further examine the effect of GSK3 inhibition on NF-\u03baB p65 expression, we treated N2a cells with ARA and subjected them to subcellular fractionation (Figure 4E). ARA treatment significantly reduced nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 levels to 46.9% \u00b1 9.1% as compared with control (P < 0.01) (Figure 4F). Moreover, ARA treatment also reduced cytosolic NF-\u03baB p65 levels to 56.1% \u00b1 7.1% as compared with control (P < 0.001) (Figure 4G). These data show that GSK3 inhibition with ARA reduced NF-\u03baB activity by decreasing NF-\u03baB p65 levels. Taken together, our results demonstrate that NF-\u03baB signaling mediates the regulatory effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 gene expression. GSK3 regulates BACE1 gene expression, APP processing, and A\u03b2 production in vivo. Our data provide strong evidence that GSK3\u03b2 activates BACE1 gene expression, resulting in enhanced \u03b2-secretase processing of APP and A\u03b2 production in vitro. To examine the effect of GSK3 signaling on BACE1 gene expression and APP processing in vivo, we first assayed APP CTFs and A\u03b2 production in the brain of APP23/PS45 mice by Western blot analysis (Figure 5, A and B). APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice, an AD mouse model, were generated by crossing APP23 mice, carrying the human Swedish mutant APP751 transgene driven by the neuron-specific Thy1.2 promoter, and PS45 mice, carrying the human familial AD\u2013associated G384A mutant presenilin-1 (PS1) (54). The mice were treated with 5 mg/kg of the GSK3 inhibitor ARA at 6 weeks of age daily for 4 weeks, while age-matched control mice received vehicle solution. ARA treatment significantly decreased the brain levels of the \u03b2-secretase\u2013generated CTF\u03b2 fragments C99 and C89, to 38.4% \u00b1 4.8% relative to controls (P < 0.05) (Figure 5B). The levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 were reduced to 71.2% \u00b1 8.3% and 65.6% \u00b1 11.0% in ARA-treated mice relative to controls, (P < 0.05) (Figure 5, C and D). These data demonstrate that inhibition of GSK3 activity by ARA treatment reduces \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo. ARA inhibits BACE1 cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo.Figure 5ARA inhibits BACE1 cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo. (A) Hemi-brains from ARA-treated and control APP23/PS45 mice of the 6 weeks age group were homogenized in RIPA-Doc lysis buffer and separated with 12% Tris-glycine or 16% Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE. Full-length APP and APP CTFs (C99 and C89) were detected by C20 polyclonal antibody. PS1 was detected by anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody 231. BACE1 was detected by anti-BACE1 antibody. \u03b2-Actin was detected by anti\u2013\u03b2-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control. (B) Quantification showed that CTF\u03b2 was significantly decreased in ARA-treated mice. n = 25 mice total. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, Student\u2019s t test. ELISA was performed to measure A\u03b240 (C) and A\u03b242 (D) levels from the brain tissues of APP23/PS45 mice injected with or without ARA. n = 8 for each group; *P < 0.005, Student\u2019s t test. (E) Total RNA was isolated from APP23/PS45 mouse cortices by TRI Reagent. Sets of gene-specific primers were used to amplify Bace1 (E), PS1 (G), and App (I) genes. \u03b2-Actin was used as an internal control. Bace1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced (F), while there were no difference in endogenous PS1 (H) or App (J) mRNA levels between ARA-treated mice and controls. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 12 total; *P < 0.01, Student\u2019s t test. We then examined whether the level of BACE1 was altered by GSK3 signaling in vivo. Western blot analysis showed that inhibition of GSK3 signaling significantly reduced the protein level of BACE1 to 64.7% \u00b1 7.3% in ARA-treated mice, as compared with the control mice (P < 0.01), and the treatment had no significant effect on APP and PS1 protein levels (P > 0.05) (Figure 5, A and B). We further showed that GSK3 inhibition with ARA reduced tau phosphorylation, which is consistent with previous findings (ref. 62 and Supplemental Figure 1A). Our in vitro study has shown that GSK3\u03b2 regulates the transcription of the BACE1 gene. To confirm that the decrease in BACE1 protein level seen in the brains of the ARA-treated mice was due to reduced BACE1 gene transcription, the endogenous Bace1 mRNA levels were measured (Figure 5, E, G, and I). ARA treatment markedly reduced Bace1 mRNA level to 36.7% \u00b1 11.8% (P < 0.01) (Figure 5F), but did not significantly change the mRNA levels of App and PS1 genes (P > 0.05) (Figure 5, H and J). These data demonstrate that, consistent with the in vitro results, inhibition of GSK3 specifically inhibited Bace1 gene expression and its \u03b2-secretase activity in vivo. Our study has demonstrated that NF-\u03baB signaling is required for GSK3\u03b2\u2019s regulatory effect on BACE1 gene expression in vitro. To confirm this effect in vivo, we examined whether NF-\u03baB activity was affected in APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice administered ARA. EMSA was used to assess NF-\u03baB consensus DNA binding in whole brain lysates. ARA treatment inhibited the binding of NF-\u03baB p65 protein to the cis-acting consensus oligonucleotide probe, resulting in a reduction in the intensity of the p65 NF-\u03baB shifted bands (Figure 6A). The specificity of the bands was confirmed by competition assay with addition of \u00d710 and \u00d7100 unlabeled wild-type NF-\u03baB oligonucleotides (oligos), while the mutant NF-\u03baB oligos did not have any significant effect on the shifted bands (Figure 6B). Consistent with the in vitro experiment, APP23/PS45 mice receiving ARA treatment showed a significant reduction in NF-\u03baB levels to 62.9% \u00b1 6.9% of those in the sham-injected controls (P < 0.005) (Figure 6, C and D). Thus, inhibition of GSK3 signaling attenuates NF-\u03baB binding to cis-acting p65 binding elements by reducing NF-\u03baB levels in the AD transgenic model mice in vivo. ARA reduced NF-\u03baB binding in APP23/PS45 mouse brains.Figure 6ARA reduced NF-\u03baB binding in APP23/PS45 mouse brains. APP23/PS45 mice were injected daily with ARA for 4 weeks, and whole brain lysates were subjected to EMSA. (A) Mice that received ARA had reduced intensity of NF-\u03baB shifted band. n = 3. (B) Whole brain lysates subjected to EMSA was competed with 10- and 100-fold excess of the wild-type and mutant NF-\u03baB oligos to demonstrate the specificity of binding. (C) Daily injections of ARA to APP23/PS45 mice for 6 weeks reduced NF-\u03baB p65 levels in the whole brain lysates. (D) Quantification of the band intensity of NF-\u03baB p65 levels. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 25 total; *P < 0.005. GSK3 inhibition reduces neuritic plaque formation in the AD model mice. To examine the specific effect of GSK3 signaling on AD pathogenesis, we treated APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice with ARA. The double transgenic mice develop detectable neuritic plaques in the neocortex and hippocampus as early as 1 month of age. The mice were treated with 5 mg/kg ARA at 6 weeks of age daily for 4 weeks, while age-matched control mice received vehicle solution. 4G8 immunostaining and thioflavin-S staining were used to detect A\u03b2-containing neuritic plaques in the brains (ref. 63 and Figure 7). ARA treatment significantly decreased the number of neuritic plaques in the transgenic mice relative to the vehicle-injected group (Figure 7, A and B). Quantification showed that overall ARA treatment reduced plaque number by approximately 50% (23.8 \u00b1 4.7 vs. 10.4 \u00b1 1.3 per slice, P < 0.01) (Figure 7C). Thioflavin-S staining also confirmed that ARA treatment dramatically reduced the number of A\u03b2-containing neuritic plaques in the brains of APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice (Figure 7, D and E). The inhibitory effect of ARA was reversible, and the treated mice (Figure 7G) had plaque numbers similar to those in the control mice (Figure 7F) when examined 3 months after the end of the drug treatment (36.5 \u00b1 5.1 vs. 32.1 \u00b1 4.2, P > 0.05) (Figure 7H). During the 4-week injection period, ARA treatment of the mice did not affect food consumption, and no significant weight changes were observed between the treatment and control groups (data not shown). AR-A014418 treatment significantly reduces neuritic plaque formation in ADFigure 7AR-A014418 treatment significantly reduces neuritic plaque formation in AD transgenic mice. (A and B) APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice at the age of 6 weeks were treated with ARA (5 mg/kg) for 4 weeks, while age-matched control APP23/PS45 mice received vehicle solution. The mice were sacrificed after behavioral tests, and the brains were dissected, fixed, and sectioned. Neuritic plaques were detected using A\u03b2 specific monoclonal antibody 4G8 (Signet). The plaques were visualized by microscopy with \u00d740 magnification.

Inhibition of GSK3 significantly improves memory deficits in the AD model mice. To investigate whether GSK3 inhibition by ARA treatment affects the memory deficit in AD pathogenesis, we used the Morris water maze to test spatial memory after APP23/PS45 mice received 1 month of ARA treatment (64). In the visible platform tests, ARA-treated and control APP23/PS45 mice had similar escape latency (42.4 \u00b1 4.3 and 44.8 \u00b1 2.7 seconds, P > 0.05) (Figure 8A) and path length (6.6 \u00b1 0.7 m and 6.1 \u00b1 0.5 m, P > 0.05) (Figure 8B), indicating that ARA treatment did not affect mouse mobility or vision. In the hidden platform test, ARA-treated mice showed significant improvements as compared with the vehicle-treated controls. The escape latency on the third and fourth days of the hidden platform test was shorter (12.0 \u00b1 1.6 and 17.4 \u00b1 3.1 seconds) than that of sham-treated mice (23.8 \u00b1 4.0 s and 24.9 \u00b1 2.7 s) (P < 0.05, Figure 8C). The ARA-treated mice swam significantly shorter distances to reach the platform (2.9 \u00b1 0.7 m and 3.2 \u00b1 0.3 m) as compared with control mice (3.7 \u00b1 0.6 and 4.2 \u00b1 0.5 m) on the third and fourth days (P < 0.05, Figure 8D). In the probe trial on the last day of testing, the platform was removed. ARA treatment significantly improved the spatial memory in the APP23/PS45 mice, as these mice spent more time searching for the platform in the appropriate quadrant (Supplemental Figure 3A). The number of times the mice traveled into the third quadrant, where the hidden platform was previously placed, was significantly greater with ARA treatment as compared with control (6.0 \u00b1 1.0 and 2.0 \u00b1 1.2 times, P < 0.05) (Figure 8E). Moreover, ARA-treated mice spent nearly twice as long in the southwest (SW) quadrant, where the platform was originally placed during the hidden platform test (NE 16.3.9% \u00b1 1.3%, SE 19.2% \u00b1 1.6%, SW 44.0% \u00b1 3.1%, NW 20.4% \u00b1 2.0%). The sham-treated mice, however, spent approximately equal amounts of time in each quadrant (NE 24.9% \u00b1 1.9%, SE 20.4% \u00b1 2.0%, SW 28.2% \u00b1 1.7%, NW 26.6% \u00b1 2.1%) (Supplemental Figure 3B). These data demonstrate that inhibition of GSK3 signaling significantly improved the memory deficits seen in the AD model mice. ARA improves memory deficits in AD transgenic mice.Figure 8ARA improves memory deficits in AD transgenic mice. A Morris water maze test consists of 1 day of visible platform trials and 4 days of hidden platform trials, plus a probe trial 24 hours after the last hidden platform trial. Animal movement was tracked and recorded by ANY-maze tracking software.

GSK3 is involved in tau hyperphosphorylation (65), neuronal apoptosis (66), and synaptic dysfunction (67). Moreover, GSK3 signaling has also been implicated in A\u03b2 production and neuritic plaque formation (51, 54, 68). However, the mechanism by which GSK3 affects APP processing and A\u03b2 production has not been clearly elucidated, and its pharmaceutical potential as an effective drug target remains to be validated. The current study clearly indicates that GSK3\u03b2, but not the related GSK3\u03b1 isoform, facilitates A\u03b2 production by upregulating BACE1 gene expression via NF-\u03baB p65 cis-acting elements on the BACE1 gene promoter. The C-terminal end of BACE1 undergoes phosphorylation, which regulates BACE1 trafficking and cellular levels (69, 70). In our study, inhibition of GSK3 signaling did not affect the phosphorylation status of BACE1 (data not shown). Thus, specifically inhibiting GSK3 decreases BACE1 expression and markedly reduces \u03b2-secretase processing of APP and A\u03b2 production, resulting in inhibition of neuritic plaque formation and amelioration of memory deficits in AD model mice. GSK3 appears to be a common molecular link between amyloidogenesis and tau abnormalities in AD pathology. Therefore, GSK3 inhibition has been proposed to be a valid therapeutic target for treating AD. Lithium chloride and valproic acid are known to have some inhibitory effects on GSK3 (71, 72) and have been used in the clinic for many decades for the treatment of bipolar disorders and epilepsy. Recent work has demonstrated that lithium and valproic acid could reduce A\u03b2 levels and improve cognitive performance in mouse models of AD (54, 68). While the inhibitory effects of lithium and valproic acid on GSK3 are known, both compounds have also been found to affect signaling cascades independent of GSK3. To further investigate the role of GSK3 on APP processing, we administered ARA, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of GSK3 (IC50 = 104 \u00b1 27 nM) (73) to APP Swedish stable cell lines and APP23/PS45 mice. We found that with specific GSK3 inhibition, the BACE1 major product C99 is reduced, accompanied by a significant reduction in A\u03b2 levels. Previous reports indicated that ARA treatment reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and tangle formation in transgenic mice overexpressing human tau, a model of AD (62). Our study shows that ARA also reduces plaque pathology and rescues cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model. However, continuous ARA treatment is required in order to reduce plaque pathology, as APP23/PS45 mice sacrificed 3 months after the last injection had plaque levels similar to those in the control group. Previous work by Phiel et al. (51) demonstrated that inhibition of GSK3\u03b1 with isoform-specific siRNA decreases \u03b3-secretase activity but found no effect of GSK3\u03b2. In our study, we found that in a system in which \u03b3-secretase activity is pharmacologically inhibited, GSK3\u03b1 knockdown did not have any significant effect on APP processing. On the other hand, GSK3\u03b2 knockdown with inhibition of \u03b3-secretase activity reduced the level of C99 fragment, indicating that BACE1 activity is affected. We further provided evidence that knocking down GSK3\u03b2 reduced BACE1 mRNA levels, but knocking down GSK3\u03b1 did not affect BACE1 expression. Previous genetic studies have found that during development GSK3\u03b1 could not compensate for the loss of GSK3\u03b2, as Gsk3b-KO mice are embryonic lethal while Gsk3a-KO mice are viable (61). This argues that GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 isoforms may have distinct cellular functions with respect to BACE1 expression. Moreover, GSK3\u03b2 is the predominant isoform in the brain and therefore has been implicated in many CNS disorders (74). However, Jaworski et al. recently showed the GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 knockout mice did not show any changes to APP processing and A\u03b2 production (52). This could be due to a physiological compensation of BACE1 expression in the KO mice compared with the acute effect of the GSK3 inhibitor. Additionally, our data showed that GSK3\u03b2 regulated NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated BACE1 expression. Gsk3a knockout had no effect on NF-\u03baB signaling. Taken together, these studies suggest that GSK3 isoforms have distinct roles in regulating APP processing. We do not believe that gene silencing of GSK3 isoforms would be a valid approach for treating AD. Complete ablation of each isoform may lead to compensatory elevated activity of the other isoform or even other functionally protein kinases. Moreover, it has been reported that complete ablation of GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 expression in mice results in various abnormalities (75), which may interfere with any therapeutic values. Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested a significant inflammatory component in AD (76\u201379). However, it remains controversial whether neuroinflammation is a driving force for AD or simply a byproduct of the disease (80). Moreover, the detrimental role of astrocyte and microglia during neuroinflammation remains elusive. The release of various proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines has been shown to affect APP processing, A\u03b2 production, and neurodegenerative changes in AD brains. There have been preclinical studies to show that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or anti-inflammatory cytokines have beneficial effects in treating AD (80, 81). However, there are reports demonstrating that anti-inflammatory stimuli could potentiate A\u03b2 production, possibly through suppression of glia-mediated A\u03b2 clearance. On the other hand, proinflammatory stimuli could also have extreme effects on AD pathogenesis. There is a large amount of evidence to show that increased proinflammatory cytokines correlates with A\u03b2 production and neurodegeneration. In contrast, there are also a number of studies indicating that proinflammatory cytokines precondition the system for A\u03b2 challenge and protect against neurodegeneration (82\u201385). Clearly, inflammation is a major component of the AD brain, and more work will be required in order to elucidate its role in AD pathogenesis. Since several proinflammatory cytokines including the interleukins and TNF have been found to activate GSK3\u03b2, and GSK3 inhibitors showed anti-inflammatory effects (86\u201388), we speculate that GSK3 plays an important role in the inflammatory response driving A\u03b2 production. The chronic inflammatory response induced by A\u03b2 may depend on transcription factors to exert neurodegenerative effects. Regulation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and its transcriptional activity may in part play a role in A\u03b2-mediated neurodegeneration (27, 89). It has been previously reported that the BACE1 promoter contains NF-\u03baB\u2013binding elements (27, 90) and exacerbated A\u03b2 levels modulate the BACE1 promoter activity via NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent pathways (91). More recently, Chen et al. (27) found increased NF-\u03baB p65 and BACE1 expression in postmortem AD brains. Furthermore, overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 was found to increase human BACE1 promoter activity, whereas inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling reduced BACE1 expression (27). Exogenous application of A\u03b2 has been found to increase GSK3\u03b2 activity and NF-\u03baB levels. There are many reports suggesting that GSK3\u03b2 regulates gene transcription in an NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent manner (61, 92, 93). Therefore, we argue that the GSK3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is involved in regulating BACE1 gene transcription. In this study, we found that interfering with GSK3\u03b2 activity using Gsk3b-KO cells or ARA treatment reduced BACE1 promoter activity and gene expression. Moreover, disrupting NF-\u03baB expression also blocked GSK3\u03b2-induced BACE1 transcription. Long-term treatment with GSK3 inhibitors always raises the concern about unwanted side effects. Many of the Wnt signal transduction components such as the APC gene or \u03b2-catenin gene carry mutations that render the protein nondegradable (94). Prolonged activation of the Wnt pathway has been linked to development of various cancers (95). GSK3 inhibitors including SB216763, SB415286, Kenpaullone, and lithium chloride have all been shown to elevate the level of \u03b2-catenin (51, 96, 97). Consequently, it may be possible that GSK3 inhibitors may mimic Wnt signaling and could potentially be oncogenic. However, long-term use of lithium chloride to treat bipolar disorder has not been linked to increased risk of cancer. Interestingly, administration of the GSK3 inhibitors CHIR99021 and ARA did not change \u03b2-catenin levels (65). Moreover, \u03b2-catenin levels are largely unaffected in Gsk3b-KO embryos (61). These findings indicate that the inhibition of GSK3 by itself might not be sufficient to elevate the level of \u03b2-catenin. It is possible that there are specific pools of GSK3 that are insensitive to certain GSK3 inhibitors, thereby sparing the effect of increasing \u03b2-catenin levels. In order to validate the therapeutic efficacy of GSK3 inhibition, while minimizing oncogenic side effects, long-term treatment studies in cells and animals will be required. In conclusion, we have found that the GSK3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway regulates BACE1 transcription and thereby facilitates A\u03b2 production in AD. Since GSK3\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB are involved in AD pathogenesis, our results suggest that direct interference of this pathway may be a promising drug target for AD therapy. MethodsCell culture, transfection, and ARA treatment. All cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in an incubator containing 5% CO2. HEK293 (human embryonic kidney), N2a (mouse neuroblastoma), SHSY5Y (human neuroblastoma), and wild-type MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) were maintained in complete DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Gsk3b-KO fibroblast cells were derived from E12.5 Gsk3b-KO mouse embryos and were maintained in complete DMEM (61). The 20E2 cell line is a Swedish mutant APP695 stable HEK293 cell line cultured in complete DMEM with 50 \u03bcg/ml geneticin (98). 293B2 cells stably expressing human BACE1 in HEK293 cell line were cultured in complete DMEM with 100 \u03bcg/ml Zeocin (99). The RelA-KO fibroblast cell line, derived from E12.5\u2013E14.5 mouse embryo fibroblasts, was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and ESGRO (LIF) (100). S9A-GSK3\u03b2 stably transfected SHSY5Y cells, under the control of the tetracycline-regulated mammalian expression T-Rex system (Invitrogen), were maintained in complete DMEM (60). S9A-GSK3\u03b2 gene induction was achieved by stimulation with 1 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline (60). Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using either calcium phosphate or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). L685,458, G2, and ARA (EMD Biosciences) were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with complete cell culture medium. The final DMSO concentrations in each experiment were less than 0.5%. Luciferase assay. BACE1 promoter constructs were transfected into N2a cells and wild-type and Gsk3b-KO MEFs. The Renilla (sea pansy) luciferase vector pCMV-Rluc was co-transfected to normalize transfection efficiency. A luciferase assay was performed 48 hours after transfection with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) as previously described (27). Semiquantitative RT-PCR. RNA was isolated from cells using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). A Thermoscript Reverse Transcription kit (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA from an equal amount of RNA following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The newly synthesized cDNA templates were further amplified via Platinum Taq DNA polymerase in a 20-\u03bcl reaction. The following primers were used to specifically amplify BACE1, GSK3A, GSK3B, APP, and PS1 genes: BACE1 forward 5\u2032-cccgcagacgctcaacatcc and reverse 5\u2032-GCCACTGTCCACAATGCTCTT; GSK3A forward 5\u2032-TGAAGCTGGGCCGTGACAGCGG and reverse 5\u2032-ACATGTACACCTTGACATAG; GSK3B forward 5\u2032-TCAGGAGTGCGGGTCTTCCGAC and reverse 5\u2032-CTCCAGTATTAGCATCTGACGCT; APP forward 5\u2032-GCTGGCCTGCTGGCTGAACC and reverse 5\u2032-GGCGACGGTGTGCCAGTGAA; PS1 forward 5\u2032-GAGACACAGGACAGTGGTTCTGG and reverse 5\u2032-GGCCGATCAGTATGGCTACAAA. \u03b2-Actin was used as an internal control. The samples were resolved and analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel. Immunoblot analysis. Brain tissues or cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 4% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) supplemented with 200 mM sodium orthovanadate, 25 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM PMSF, and a complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche Diagnostics). The samples were diluted in 4\u00d7 SDS-sample buffer, boiled, and resolved on 12% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE or 16% Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvindylidine fluoride (PVDF-FL) membranes. For immunoblot analysis, membranes were blocked for 1 hour in PBS containing 5% nonfat dried milk, followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C in primary antibodies diluted in the blocking medium. Rabbit anti-APP C-terminal polyclonal antibody C20 was used to detect APP and its CTF products. PS1 was detected by anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody 231. Total GSK3\u03b2 was determined using a pan-specific mouse anti-GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 antibody (BioSource International Inc.). Total \u03b2-catenin was determined using a pan-specific rabbit anti\u2013\u03b2-catenin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). The NF-\u03baB p65 subunit was determined using mouse anti-p65 (Sigma-Aldrich). Internal control \u03b2-actin was analyzed using monoclonal antibody AC-15 (Sigma-Aldrich). BACE1 was detected with the anti-BACE1 antibody 208 recognizing the C-terminal end (101). A\u03b240/42 ELISA. HEK293 cells stably expressing the human APP gene containing the Swedish mutation were maintained in cell culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS. Following ARA treatment for 24 hours, conditioned medium was harvested, and protease inhibitors and AEBSF (Roche Diagnostics) were added to prevent degradation of A\u03b2 peptides. APP23/PS45 double transgenic mouse cortical tissues were prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions prior to carrying out the ELISA protocol (Invitrogen). The concentration of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 were detected using an A\u03b21\u201340 or A\u03b21\u201342 Colorimetric ELISA kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. EMSA. Whole brain extracts were prepared by homogenizing the tissue in Buffer C (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitor. EMSA was performed as previously described with a few changes (102). Briefly, 20\u201340 \u03bcg protein was incubated with an IRDye 700\u2013labeled NF-\u03baB oligo (5\u2032-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC), and the gels were scanned using the Odyssey system (LI-COR Biosciences). In the competition assay, unlabeled wild-type and mutant (5\u2032-AGTTGAGGCCACTTTCCCAGGC) NF-\u03baB oligos at \u00d710 and \u00d7100 molar excess were used to compete for binding. Transgenic mice and drug treatment. APP23 mice overexpressing the Swedish APP751 (KM\u2192NL) mutant transgene driven by the mouse Thy1.2 promoter were originally generated at Novartis Pharma as previously described (30, 103). APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice were generated by crossing APP23 mice with mice overexpressing the human G384A-mutated PS1 under the control of the murine Thy1 promoter (B6,D2-TgN(Thy1-PS1G384A)45) (54, 103\u2013105). APP23 and PS45 mice had been backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice for more than 7 generations prior to breeding for the double transgenic mice. The genotype of the mice was confirmed by PCR using DNA from tail tissues. The treatment group contained 14 animals (8 females, 6 males), and the sham-injected group contained 12 animals (7 females, 5 males). The treatment group received 5 mg/kg ARA diluted in 0.9% saline daily via intraperitoneal injection at the same time each day. Mice in the control group were injected with the vehicle solution containing DMSO diluted in 0.9% saline only. We tabulated the daily food consumption and weight for each mouse. Immunohistochemical staining. Mice were sacrificed after behavioral testing, and half brains were immediately homogenized for protein, RNA, or DNA extraction. The other halves of the brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned with a Leica Cryostat to 30-\u03bcm thickness. Every twelfth slice with the same reference position was mounted onto slides for staining. Immunocytochemical staining was performed on floating sections. The plaques in the sections were detected with biotinylated monoclonal 4G8 antibody (Signetlabs) in 1:500 dilution, visualized by the ABC and DAB method, and counted under a \u00d740 objective as previously described (54, 63). Plaques were quantified, and the average plaque count per slice was recorded for each mouse. Thioflavin-S staining of plaques was performed with 1% thioflavin-S visualized using fluorescence microscopy (54). Morris water maze test. The Morris water maze test was performed as previously described (30, 64). The APP23/PS45 mice treated with or without ARA were subjected to the Morris water maze test 1 day after the last injection regimen. The test was performed in a 1.5-meter-diameter pool with a 10-cm-diameter platform placed in the SE quadrant of the pool. The procedure consisted of 1 day of visible platform tests and 4 days of hidden platform tests, plus a probe trial 24 hours after the last hidden platform test. In the visible platform test performed on the first day, the mice were tested for 5 continuous trials, with an inter-trial interval of 60 minutes. In the hidden platform tests, mice were trained for 5 trials, with an inter-trial interval of 1 hour. Each mouse was allowed 60 seconds to search for the platform. In the scenario where the mouse could not locate the platform, the experiment guided it to the platform and allowed the mouse to rest there for 15 seconds. On the last day of the test, each mouse was subjected to the probe trial in which the platform was removed. Each mouse was given 60 seconds to locate where the platform was originally placed. Mouse behavior including distance traveled, escape latency and the number of passes through the platform was recorded by automated video tracking (ANY-maze, Stoelting). The data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. Statistics. All results were presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and analyzed by ANOVA or 2-tailed Student\u2019s t-test. Statistical significance is accepted when P < 0.05. Study approval. Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the University of British Columbia Animal Care and Use Committee and Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) guidelines.Supplemental dataView Supplemental dataAcknowledgmentsWe thank Steven R.

First published December 3, 2012Received for publication April 26, 2012, and accepted in revised form September 27, 2012.Deposition of amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) to form neuritic plaques in the brain is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). A\u03b2 is generated from sequential cleavages of the \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases, and \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the \u03b2-secretase essential for A\u03b2 generation. Previous studies have indicated that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) may play a role in APP processing by modulating \u03b3-secretase activity, thereby facilitating A\u03b2 production. There are two highly conserved isoforms of GSK3: GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2. We now report that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production by decreasing BACE1 gene transcription and expression. The regulation of BACE1 gene expression by GSK3\u03b2 was dependent on NF-\u03baB signaling. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling markedly reduced A\u03b2 deposition and neuritic plaque formation, and rescued memory deficits in the double transgenic AD model mice. These data provide evidence for regulation of BACE1 expression and AD pathogenesis by GSK3\u03b2 and that inhibition of GSK3 signaling can reduce A\u03b2 neuropathology and alleviate memory deficits in AD model mice. Our study suggests that interventions that specifically target the \u03b2-isoform of GSK3 may be a safe and effective approach for treating AD. IntroductionAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia. The characteristic neuropathological features of AD include neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2), the central component of neuritic plaques, is produced from sequential endoproteolytic cleavages of the type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase. Proteolytic processing of APP at the \u03b2 site is essential for generating A\u03b2, and \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the \u03b2-secretase in vivo (1\u20134). BACE1 cleaves APP at two \u03b2-sites, Asp+1 and Glu+11 of the A\u03b2 domain, to generate C99 and C89 fragment, respectively (5). Subsequently, \u03b3-secretase cleaves C99 within its transmembrane domain to release A\u03b2 and APP C-terminal fragment \u03b3 (CTF\u03b3). In addition to APP, BACE1 substrates also include other proteins: LRP (6), APLP1 (7), APLP2 (8), ST6Gal I (9), and PSGL-1 (10). BACE1 expression is tightly regulated at the level of transcription (5, 11, 12) and translation (13\u201316). It was reported that a G/C polymorphism in exon 5 of the BACE1 gene might be associated with some sporadic cases of AD (17\u201319). Although genetic analyses from our and other laboratories have failed to uncover any mutation in the BACE1 coding sequence or any disease-associated SNP in its promoter region in AD patients (20\u201322), increased \u03b2-secretase levels and activity have been reported in AD (23\u201327). BACE1 levels were elevated in neurons around plaques (28). BACE1 mRNA levels tended to increase as miR-107 levels decreased in the progression of AD (29). We reported that hypoxia, a common vascular component among AD risk factors, increased BACE1 expression, resulting in both increased A\u03b2 deposition and memory deficits in AD transgenic mice (30). Recently we found that both NF-\u03baB and BACE1 levels were increased in sporadic AD patients, and NF-\u03baB facilitated BACE1 gene expression and APP processing (27). Thus, increased BACE1 expression by NF-\u03baB signaling in the brain could be one of the mechanisms underlying AD development (27). Together, these studies indicate that BACE1 dysregulation plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. BACE1 has been considered as one of the major targets for AD drug development. Bace1-knockout mice have abolished A\u03b2 generation (31\u201333). Suppression of BACE1 by RNA interference reduced APP processing and A\u03b2 production in primary cortical neurons derived from both wild-type and Swedish APP mutant transgenic mice (34), and disruption of the Bace1 gene rescued memory deficits and cholinergic dysfunction in Swedish APP mice (35). Oral administration of a potent and selective BACE1 inhibitor decreased \u03b2-cleavage and A\u03b2 production in APP transgenic mice in vivo (36). Bace1-KO mice were reported to display hypomyelination of peripheral nerves and aberrant axonal segregation (37, 38), suggesting that inhibiting \u03b2-secretase may have unwanted collateral effects. However, even a partial reduction in BACE1 can have dramatically beneficial effects on AD pathology (39), suggesting that therapeutic inhibition of BACE1 is a valid therapeutic target for AD treatment. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinase originally identified as playing an important role in glycogen metabolism. Since its discovery, many studies have shown that GSK3 has pleiotropic functions, including embryonic development, gene transcription, and neuronal cell function (40). In mammals, two GSK3 isoforms are encoded by distinct genes: GSK3A produces a 51-kDa GSK3\u03b1 protein and GSK3B a 47-kDa GSK3\u03b2 protein (41). These two isoforms are highly homologous, sharing greater than 95% amino acid identity in the catalytic domains. Although both isoforms are ubiquitously expressed, the \u03b2 isoform is expressed at higher levels in neuronal tissues (42). GSK3 activity is regulated at several levels. Phosphorylation of Tyr279/Tyr216 on GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 is important for enzymatic activity (43). Inactivation of GSK3 can be achieved through phosphorylation of Ser21/Ser9 residues within the N-terminal domain on GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2, respectively. Stimulation of tissues by insulin and growth factors activates the PI3K/PKB/Akt signal transduction cascade, leading to phosphorylation of these inhibitory serine residues (44, 45). GSK3 is also regulated upon interaction of the Wnt ligand and its receptor Frizzled and co-receptor LRP5/6. This interaction releases GSK3 from a multi-protein complex formed by \u03b2-catenin, axin, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (46, 47), which prevents GSK3-mediated \u03b2-catenin degradation and induces \u03b2-catenin\u2013dependent gene transcription. Dysregulation of GSK3 activity has been implicated in AD. Increased GSK3\u03b2 activity was found in postmortem AD brains (48). GSK3\u03b2 has been found to phosphorylate the tau protein on various conserved sites and contribute to tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation (49, 50). GSK3\u03b1 was reported to regulate A\u03b2 production by positively modulating the \u03b3-secretase complex (51), although this finding has recently been challenged (52). Inhibition of GSK3 activity with the commonly known GSK3 inhibitors LiCl and valproic acid in cell culture (53) and animal models of AD decreased A\u03b2 production (51, 54). Although LiCl and valproic acid are known to inhibit GSK3 activity, these compounds also activate a plethora of signaling cascades that could differentially regulate APP processing independent of GSK3 (55\u201358). In this study, we examined the effects of GSK3\u03b2-specific inhibition on AD neuropathology and behavioral deficits and identified its underlying mechanism. We found that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP. Treatment with the GSK3 inhibitor AR-A014418 (ARA) reduced neuritic plaque formation and alleviated memory deficits in AD transgenic model mice. Furthermore, we found that GSK3\u03b2 regulated BACE1 transcription via NF-\u03baB signaling. Our work provides evidence that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 may be an effective therapeutic approach for treating AD. ResultsRegulation of \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production by GSK3 signaling. Previous studies showed that LiCl and valproic acid modulated GSK3 signaling and reduced A\u03b2 production (51, 54). However, the underlying mechanism is not well defined, and these compounds also have many confounding GSK3-independent effects. To examine the specific effect of GSK3 signaling on APP processing, we applied ARA, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of GSK3, to 20E2 cells, a stable cell line expressing human Swedish mutant APP (5). ARA at 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM significantly decreased the levels of the \u03b2-secretase cleavage product APP C99 to 95.7% \u00b1 1.6%, 66.4% \u00b1 0.7%, and 31.3% \u00b1 0.4%, respectively (P < 0.001 by 1-way ANOVA) (Figure 1A and B). The treatment had no significant effect on APP expression (Figure 1A). The A\u03b2 ELISA was performed to assess the levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 in the conditioned media of 20E2 cells. ARA markedly reduced A\u03b2 generation in a dose-dependent manner. A\u03b240 was decreased to 99.2% \u00b1 3.8%, 73.2% \u00b1 4.6%, and 48.7% \u00b1 1.3% with 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM of ARA treatment, respectively (P < 0.05) (Figure 1C); and A\u03b242 was reduced to 99.2% \u00b1 3.1%, 73.2% \u00b1 3.5%, and 48.7% \u00b1 4.5% with 1, 2.5 and 5 \u03bcM of ARA treatment, respectively (P < 0.01 by 1-way ANOVA) (Figure 1D). As expected, inhibition of GSK3 stabilized \u03b2-catenin (Figure 1A), and ARA treatment resulted in a significant increase in \u03b2-catenin levels to 152.7% \u00b1 11.1%, 221.3% \u00b1 17.0%, and 233.7% \u00b1 25.0% with 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM, respectively (P < 0.05). These data indicate that specifically inhibiting GSK3 reduced BACE1-mediated APP processing and C99 and A\u03b2 production. Specific inhibition of GSK3 reduces BACE1 cleavage of APP.Figure 1Specific inhibition of GSK3 reduces BACE1 cleavage of APP. (A) Swedish mutant APP stable cell line 20E2 was cultured and treated with ARA for 24 hours, and cell lysates subjected to Western blot analysis. Full-length APP and the APP CTFs were detected with C20 antibody. \u03b2-Catenin was detected by anti\u2013\u03b2-catenin antibody. \u03b2-Actin was detected by anti-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control.

(F) Quantification of C99 levels. n = 6; *P < 0.05, ANOVA. To further examine the effect of GSK3 on \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production, we pharmacologically blocked \u03b3-secretase activity with the \u03b3-secretase\u2013specific inhibitor L658,458 in 20E2 cells while co-treating with the GSK3 inhibitor ARA and G2. G2 is another structurally distinct GSK3 inhibitor, with an IC50 of 304 nM (59). As expected, \u03b3-secretase inhibition resulted in markedly increased generation of the APP CTFs C83 and C99 (Figure 1E). Addition of ARA or G2 reduced C99 levels to 78.2% \u00b1 1.1% and 63.9% \u00b1 6.6% (Figure 1, E and F). ARA treatment had no significant effect on Notch cleavage (Supplemental Figure 1B; supplemental material available online with this article; doi: 10.1172/JCI64516DS1). These data demonstrated that specific inhibition of GSK3 reduced \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP to generate C99 and A\u03b2 production in cells. GSK3\u03b2 but not GSK3\u03b1 regulates BACE1 gene expression and BACE1-mediated APP processing. Our study has shown that GSK3 regulated \u03b2-secretase processing of APP, an essential step for A\u03b2 generation. Since BACE1 is the \u03b2-secretase in vivo, we first examined whether GSK3 affects BACE1 gene expression. GSK3 has two highly homologous isoforms, GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2. We used RNA interference to specifically knock down the expression of GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 isoforms in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to determine whether both isoforms or one of the isoforms play a major role in regulating BACE1 gene expression. Specific knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 expression by the siRNA significantly reduced BACE1 mRNA levels to 76.0% \u00b1 6.6% as compared with control (P < 0.05) (Figure 2, A and B), whereas knockdown of GSK3\u03b1 did not affect BACE1 mRNA expression (P > 0.05) (Figure 2, A and B). Additional exogenous expression of GSK3\u03b2 rescued the reduction of BACE1 expression resulting from knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 by siRNA (Supplemental Figure 2). To examine whether specific knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 expression also affected \u03b2-secretase processing of APP, we transfected siRNA specific to GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 into 20E2 cells while inhibiting \u03b3-secretase activity with L658,458. Western blotting showed that GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 siRNA specifically reduced GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 expression, respectively (Figure 2C). Knockdown of GSK3\u03b1 expression did not significantly affect BACE1-mediated APP processing, whereas GSK3\u03b2 knockdown reduced the production of the BACE1 cleavage product C99 to 51.9% \u00b1 6.4% (P < 0.05) (Figure 2, C and D). GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, regulates BACE1 gene expression and APP processing.Figure 2GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, regulates BACE1 gene expression and APP processing. (A) SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were transfected with scrambled GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 isoform\u2013specific siRNA. RNA was extracted, and semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed to measure endogenous human BACE1, GSK3A, GSK3B, and \u03b2-actin mRNA levels with specific primers recognizing the coding sequence of each gene. PCR products after 28 cycles were analyzed on 1.2% agarose gel. (B) Endogenous BACE1 mRNA was significantly reduced with GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, isoform\u2013specific knockdown. The values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 3; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. (C) 20E2 cells were transfected with scrambled or GSK3\u03b1, or GSK3\u03b2 isoform\u2013specific siRNA while cotreated with L685,458 to block \u03b3-secretase activity. Full-length APP and CTF fragments were detected with C20 antibody. GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 were detected using a monoclonal GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 antibody. GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 isoforms were selectively reduced by the isoform-specific siRNA. \u03b2-Actin served as an internal control and was detected using a monoclonal anti\u2013\u03b2-actin antibody, AC-15. (D) GSK3\u03b2-specific knockdown significantly reduced C99 levels. GSK3\u03b1-specific knockdown did not have any significant effect. The values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. (E) Tetracycline-regulated SHSY5Y cells were induced to express constitutively active S9A-GSK3\u03b2. Endogenous human BACE1 mRNA levels were assessed as described above. Tetracyline-induced S9A-GSK3\u03b2 significantly increased BACE1 expression. (F) Quantification of the endogenous BACE1 mRNA level. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. To further confirm that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene expression at the transcription level, we assayed BACE1 mRNA in the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 inducible SHSY5Y stable cell line. This stable cell line carries the constitutively active mutant GSK3\u03b2, and expression of the mutant gene is under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (60). Addition of tetracycline induced the expression of active GSK3\u03b2 (Figure 2E) and resulted in significantly increased expression of BACE1 to 251.1% \u00b1 70.0% relative to the control (P < 0.05) (Figure 2F). These data demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, specifically regulates BACE1 gene expression and contribute to APP processing. GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene promoter activity. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 gene expression at the transcription level, we performed a BACE1 gene promoter assay. Two human BACE1 gene promoter deletion plasmids were constructed. Regions of the BACE1 promoter from \u20132890 to +292 bp (pB1-A) and from \u20139 to +292 bp (pB1-B) were inserted into promoterless vector pGL3-basic upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Figure 3A). To examine the effect of GSK3 on BACE1 gene promoter activity, we transfected N2a cells with pB1-A and then treated them with ARA. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling by ARA significantly decreased the promoter activity of pB1-A in N2a cells to 54.9% \u00b1 6.2% (P < 0.005) (Figure 3B). To further investigate the underlying mechanism and determine the BACE1 promoter region that mediates the transcriptional activation by GSK3 signaling, we co-transfected N2a cells with either pB1-A or pB1-B plasmid together with the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 plasmid, which carries a constitutively active form of GSK3\u03b2. Expression of active GSK3\u03b2 markedly increased the luciferase activity of pB1-A in the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 transfected cells to 144.0% \u00b1 2.0% as compared with the control (P < 0.05), but had no significant effect on the luciferase activity of pB1-B (P > 0.05) (Figure 3C). This result showed that enhancing GSK3\u03b2 signaling upregulated BACE1 gene promoter activity and the 2.8-kb promoter region is responsible for GSK3\u03b2-mediated upregulation of BACE1 transcription. To further confirm this finding, we transfected these two deletion promoter plasmids into Gsk3b-KO or wild-type cells. Ablation of Gsk3b expression in the Gsk3b-KO cells resulted in significant reduction in luciferase activity of pB1-A to 47.0% \u00b1 7.5% as compared with the wild-type control cells (P < 0.01) (Figure 3D). However, knockout of the Gsk3b gene had no significant effect on the luciferase activity of pB1-B (Figure 3D). Taken together, these results demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene expression via its effect on the BACE1 promoter. GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 promoter activation.Figure 3GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 promoter activation. (A) Schematic of the 3.3-kb (pB1-A) and 300-bp (pB1-B) human BACE1 promoter/luciferase construct. (B) The 3.5-kb human BACE1 promoter was transfected into N2a cells and treated with 5 \u03bcM ARA. GSK3 inhibition with ARA treatment resulted in a significant decrease in luciferase activity. (C) N2a cells were co-transfected with either promoter constructs and S9A-GSK3\u03b2 or a vector control. S9A-GSK3\u03b2 significantly increased the luciferase activity of the 3.3-kb BACE1 promoter construct but did not have any effect on the 300-bp promoter construct. (D) pB1-A or pB1-B constructs were transfected into Gsk3b-KO MEFs. pB1-A had significantly reduced promoter activity. All promoter data shown represent an average of at least 4 independent experiments, with each condition performed in triplicate.

Recently we reported that levels of both BACE1 and NF-\u03baB are increased in AD brains, and NF-\u03baB signaling upregulates human BACE1 gene expression by acting on the cis-acting p65-binding element in its promoter (27). Previous studies in Gsk3b-KO mice demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2 is required for proper activation of NF-\u03baB (61). As our data indicate that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene transcription, we next examined whether regulation of BACE1 transcription by GSK3\u03b2 signaling is dependent on NF-\u03baB. TNF-\u03b1 is a strong activator of NF-\u03baB p65 expression. In order to examine the specific role of NF-\u03baB in GSK3\u03b2-regulated BACE1 transcription, we transfected N2a cells with a pBACE1-4\u03baB promoter plasmid that contained only the NF-\u03baB\u2013binding elements in the human BACE1 promoter (27). After transfection, the cells were cotreated with TNF-\u03b1 and the GSK3 inhibitor ARA. ARA treatment alone consistently reduced BACE1 promoter activity (Figure 4A). TNF-\u03b1 stimulation increased pB1A promoter activity to 132.6% \u00b1 7.5% of the control (P < 0.01). However, ARA treatment reduced the TNF-\u03b1\u2013induced BACE1 promoter activation to 115.6 \u00b1 6.9% as compared with TNF-\u03b1 treatment alone (P < 0.05) (Figure 4A). Overexpression of p65 NF-\u03baB significantly increased the BACE1 promoter activity to 487.1% \u00b1 102.2% as compared with the control (P < 0.001) (Figure 3D). However, ARA did not affect NF-\u03baB p65\u2019s upregulating effect on BACE1 promoter activity (P > 0.05), indicating that GSK3 signaling may have its effect upstream of NF-\u03baB in the modulation of BACE1 transcription (Figure 4B). To further confirm ARA\u2019s effect on NF-\u03baB activity, we co-transfected N2a cells with pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc and NF-\u03baB p65 or an empty vector, followed by treatment with ARA to inhibit GSK3 signaling. ARA reduced pNF-\u03baB-Luc promoter activity to 51.9% \u00b1 9.1% as compared with control (P < 0.05) (Figure 4C). Overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 significantly increased pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc promoter activity to 203.36 \u00b1 87.38\u2013fold (P < 0.001) (Figure 4C). Additional ARA treatment did not have any significant effect on the transcriptional activation of pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc by NF-\u03baB p65 overexpression (P > 0.05) (Figure 4C). These data indicate that the p65-binding elements in the BACE1 promoter mediated the effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 transcription. GSK3\u03b2 regulation of BACE1 transcription is dependent on NF-\u03baB p65 expressioFigure 4GSK3\u03b2 regulation of BACE1 transcription is dependent on NF-\u03baB p65 expression. (A) pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB plasmid contains the 4 NF-\u03baB cis-elements from the human BACE1 promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. N2a cells were co-transfected with pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB and pCMV-RLuc. Transfected cells were treated with vehicle solution (control) or 10 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 with/without 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours. (B) N2a cells were co-transfected with pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB plasmid and pMTF-p65 or a vector control. Transfected cells were then treated with a vehicle solution or 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours. (C) pNF-\u03baB-Luc was co-transfected with pMTF-p65 or a vector control and treated with a vehicle solution or 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours. Renilla luciferase was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, Student\u2019s t test. (D) Wild-type MEFs and RelA-KO MEFs which are dysfunctional for NF-\u03baB activity, were co-transfected with a 3.5-kb human BACE1 promoter and S9A-GSK3\u03b2 or a control vector. S9A-GSK3\u03b2 overexpression in MEFs. significantly increased luciferase activity (*P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test), whereas RelA-KO MEFs did not have any significant effect. Luciferase activity is indicative of BACE1 promoter activity. All promoter data shown represent an average of at least 4 independent experiments, with each condition performed in triplicate. (E) N2a cells were treated with 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours, followed by cell fractionation. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. ARA treatment significantly reduced NF-\u03baB p65 levels in the (F) nuclear fraction (n = 6; **P < 0.001, Student\u2019s t test) and (G) cytosolic fraction. n = 6; ***P < 0.001, Student\u2019s t test. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. To confirm the role of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in GSK3\u03b2-mediated BACE1 transcription, we transfected NF-\u03baB p65 knockout RelA-KO cells and wild-type control cells with the BACE1 promoter pB1-A and the constitutively active GSK3\u03b2 expression plasmid S9A-GSK3\u03b2. In wild-type cells, activation of GSK3\u03b2 signaling by expression of S9A-GSK3\u03b2 markedly increased BACE1 promoter activity to 189.6% \u00b1 20.9% as compared with the vector control (P < 0.05), whereas activation of GSK3\u03b2 signaling by expression of S9A-GSK3\u03b2 had no effect on BACE1 promoter activity in RelA-KO cells (P > 0.05) (Figure 4D), indicating that disruption of NF-\u03baB p65 expression in RelA-KO cells abolished GSK3\u03b2\u2019s effect on the transcriptional activation of the human BACE1 gene promoter. To further examine the effect of GSK3 inhibition on NF-\u03baB p65 expression, we treated N2a cells with ARA and subjected them to subcellular fractionation (Figure 4E). ARA treatment significantly reduced nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 levels to 46.9% \u00b1 9.1% as compared with control (P < 0.01) (Figure 4F). Moreover, ARA treatment also reduced cytosolic NF-\u03baB p65 levels to 56.1% \u00b1 7.1% as compared with control (P < 0.001) (Figure 4G). These data show that GSK3 inhibition with ARA reduced NF-\u03baB activity by decreasing NF-\u03baB p65 levels. Taken together, our results demonstrate that NF-\u03baB signaling mediates the regulatory effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 gene expression. GSK3 regulates BACE1 gene expression, APP processing, and A\u03b2 production in vivo. Our data provide strong evidence that GSK3\u03b2 activates BACE1 gene expression, resulting in enhanced \u03b2-secretase processing of APP and A\u03b2 production in vitro. To examine the effect of GSK3 signaling on BACE1 gene expression and APP processing in vivo, we first assayed APP CTFs and A\u03b2 production in the brain of APP23/PS45 mice by Western blot analysis (Figure 5, A and B). APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice, an AD mouse model, were generated by crossing APP23 mice, carrying the human Swedish mutant APP751 transgene driven by the neuron-specific Thy1.2 promoter, and PS45 mice, carrying the human familial AD\u2013associated G384A mutant presenilin-1 (PS1) (54). The mice were treated with 5 mg/kg of the GSK3 inhibitor ARA at 6 weeks of age daily for 4 weeks, while age-matched control mice received vehicle solution. ARA treatment significantly decreased the brain levels of the \u03b2-secretase\u2013generated CTF\u03b2 fragments C99 and C89, to 38.4% \u00b1 4.8% relative to controls (P < 0.05) (Figure 5B). The levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 were reduced to 71.2% \u00b1 8.3% and 65.6% \u00b1 11.0% in ARA-treated mice relative to controls, (P < 0.05) (Figure 5, C and D). These data demonstrate that inhibition of GSK3 activity by ARA treatment reduces \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo. ARA inhibits BACE1 cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo.Figure 5ARA inhibits BACE1 cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo. (A) Hemi-brains from ARA-treated and control APP23/PS45 mice of the 6 weeks age group were homogenized in RIPA-Doc lysis buffer and separated with 12% Tris-glycine or 16% Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE. Full-length APP and APP CTFs (C99 and C89) were detected by C20 polyclonal antibody. PS1 was detected by anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody 231. BACE1 was detected by anti-BACE1 antibody. \u03b2-Actin was detected by anti\u2013\u03b2-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control. (B) Quantification showed that CTF\u03b2 was significantly decreased in ARA-treated mice. n = 25 mice total. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, Student\u2019s t test. ELISA was performed to measure A\u03b240 (C) and A\u03b242 (D) levels from the brain tissues of APP23/PS45 mice injected with or without ARA. n = 8 for each group; *P < 0.005, Student\u2019s t test. (E) Total RNA was isolated from APP23/PS45 mouse cortices by TRI Reagent. Sets of gene-specific primers were used to amplify Bace1 (E), PS1 (G), and App (I) genes. \u03b2-Actin was used as an internal control. Bace1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced (F), while there were no difference in endogenous PS1 (H) or App (J) mRNA levels between ARA-treated mice and controls. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 12 total; *P < 0.01, Student\u2019s t test. We then examined whether the level of BACE1 was altered by GSK3 signaling in vivo. Western blot analysis showed that inhibition of GSK3 signaling significantly reduced the protein level of BACE1 to 64.7% \u00b1 7.3% in ARA-treated mice, as compared with the control mice (P < 0.01), and the treatment had no significant effect on APP and PS1 protein levels (P > 0.05) (Figure 5, A and B). We further showed that GSK3 inhibition with ARA reduced tau phosphorylation, which is consistent with previous findings (ref. 62 and Supplemental Figure 1A). Our in vitro study has shown that GSK3\u03b2 regulates the transcription of the BACE1 gene. To confirm that the decrease in BACE1 protein level seen in the brains of the ARA-treated mice was due to reduced BACE1 gene transcription, the endogenous Bace1 mRNA levels were measured (Figure 5, E, G, and I). ARA treatment markedly reduced Bace1 mRNA level to 36.7% \u00b1 11.8% (P < 0.01) (Figure 5F), but did not significantly change the mRNA levels of App and PS1 genes (P > 0.05) (Figure 5, H and J). These data demonstrate that, consistent with the in vitro results, inhibition of GSK3 specifically inhibited Bace1 gene expression and its \u03b2-secretase activity in vivo. Our study has demonstrated that NF-\u03baB signaling is required for GSK3\u03b2\u2019s regulatory effect on BACE1 gene expression in vitro. To confirm this effect in vivo, we examined whether NF-\u03baB activity was affected in APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice administered ARA. EMSA was used to assess NF-\u03baB consensus DNA binding in whole brain lysates. ARA treatment inhibited the binding of NF-\u03baB p65 protein to the cis-acting consensus oligonucleotide probe, resulting in a reduction in the intensity of the p65 NF-\u03baB shifted bands (Figure 6A). The specificity of the bands was confirmed by competition assay with addition of \u00d710 and \u00d7100 unlabeled wild-type NF-\u03baB oligonucleotides (oligos), while the mutant NF-\u03baB oligos did not have any significant effect on the shifted bands (Figure 6B). Consistent with the in vitro experiment, APP23/PS45 mice receiving ARA treatment showed a significant reduction in NF-\u03baB levels to 62.9% \u00b1 6.9% of those in the sham-injected controls (P < 0.005) (Figure 6, C and D). Thus, inhibition of GSK3 signaling attenuates NF-\u03baB binding to cis-acting p65 binding elements by reducing NF-\u03baB levels in the AD transgenic model mice in vivo. ARA reduced NF-\u03baB binding in APP23/PS45 mouse brains.Figure 6ARA reduced NF-\u03baB binding in APP23/PS45 mouse brains. APP23/PS45 mice were injected daily with ARA for 4 weeks, and whole brain lysates were subjected to EMSA. (A) Mice that received ARA had reduced intensity of NF-\u03baB shifted band. n = 3. (B) Whole brain lysates subjected to EMSA was competed with 10- and 100-fold excess of the wild-type and mutant NF-\u03baB oligos to demonstrate the specificity of binding. (C) Daily injections of ARA to APP23/PS45 mice for 6 weeks reduced NF-\u03baB p65 levels in the whole brain lysates. (D) Quantification of the band intensity of NF-\u03baB p65 levels. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 25 total; *P < 0.005. GSK3 inhibition reduces neuritic plaque formation in the AD model mice. To examine the specific effect of GSK3 signaling on AD pathogenesis, we treated APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice with ARA. The double transgenic mice develop detectable neuritic plaques in the neocortex and hippocampus as early as 1 month of age. The mice were treated with 5 mg/kg ARA at 6 weeks of age daily for 4 weeks, while age-matched control mice received vehicle solution. 4G8 immunostaining and thioflavin-S staining were used to detect A\u03b2-containing neuritic plaques in the brains (ref. 63 and Figure 7). ARA treatment significantly decreased the number of neuritic plaques in the transgenic mice relative to the vehicle-injected group (Figure 7, A and B). Quantification showed that overall ARA treatment reduced plaque number by approximately 50% (23.8 \u00b1 4.7 vs. 10.4 \u00b1 1.3 per slice, P < 0.01) (Figure 7C). Thioflavin-S staining also confirmed that ARA treatment dramatically reduced the number of A\u03b2-containing neuritic plaques in the brains of APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice (Figure 7, D and E). The inhibitory effect of ARA was reversible, and the treated mice (Figure 7G) had plaque numbers similar to those in the control mice (Figure 7F) when examined 3 months after the end of the drug treatment (36.5 \u00b1 5.1 vs. 32.1 \u00b1 4.2, P > 0.05) (Figure 7H). During the 4-week injection period, ARA treatment of the mice did not affect food consumption, and no significant weight changes were observed between the treatment and control groups (data not shown). AR-A014418 treatment significantly reduces neuritic plaque formation in ADFigure 7AR-A014418 treatment significantly reduces neuritic plaque formation in AD transgenic mice. (A and B) APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice at the age of 6 weeks were treated with ARA (5 mg/kg) for 4 weeks, while age-matched control APP23/PS45 mice received vehicle solution. The mice were sacrificed after behavioral tests, and the brains were dissected, fixed, and sectioned. Neuritic plaques were detected using A\u03b2 specific monoclonal antibody 4G8 (Signet). The plaques were visualized by microscopy with \u00d740 magnification.

Inhibition of GSK3 significantly improves memory deficits in the AD model mice. To investigate whether GSK3 inhibition by ARA treatment affects the memory deficit in AD pathogenesis, we used the Morris water maze to test spatial memory after APP23/PS45 mice received 1 month of ARA treatment (64). In the visible platform tests, ARA-treated and control APP23/PS45 mice had similar escape latency (42.4 \u00b1 4.3 and 44.8 \u00b1 2.7 seconds, P > 0.05) (Figure 8A) and path length (6.6 \u00b1 0.7 m and 6.1 \u00b1 0.5 m, P > 0.05) (Figure 8B), indicating that ARA treatment did not affect mouse mobility or vision. In the hidden platform test, ARA-treated mice showed significant improvements as compared with the vehicle-treated controls. The escape latency on the third and fourth days of the hidden platform test was shorter (12.0 \u00b1 1.6 and 17.4 \u00b1 3.1 seconds) than that of sham-treated mice (23.8 \u00b1 4.0 s and 24.9 \u00b1 2.7 s) (P < 0.05, Figure 8C). The ARA-treated mice swam significantly shorter distances to reach the platform (2.9 \u00b1 0.7 m and 3.2 \u00b1 0.3 m) as compared with control mice (3.7 \u00b1 0.6 and 4.2 \u00b1 0.5 m) on the third and fourth days (P < 0.05, Figure 8D). In the probe trial on the last day of testing, the platform was removed. ARA treatment significantly improved the spatial memory in the APP23/PS45 mice, as these mice spent more time searching for the platform in the appropriate quadrant (Supplemental Figure 3A). The number of times the mice traveled into the third quadrant, where the hidden platform was previously placed, was significantly greater with ARA treatment as compared with control (6.0 \u00b1 1.0 and 2.0 \u00b1 1.2 times, P < 0.05) (Figure 8E). Moreover, ARA-treated mice spent nearly twice as long in the southwest (SW) quadrant, where the platform was originally placed during the hidden platform test (NE 16.3.9% \u00b1 1.3%, SE 19.2% \u00b1 1.6%, SW 44.0% \u00b1 3.1%, NW 20.4% \u00b1 2.0%). The sham-treated mice, however, spent approximately equal amounts of time in each quadrant (NE 24.9% \u00b1 1.9%, SE 20.4% \u00b1 2.0%, SW 28.2% \u00b1 1.7%, NW 26.6% \u00b1 2.1%) (Supplemental Figure 3B). These data demonstrate that inhibition of GSK3 signaling significantly improved the memory deficits seen in the AD model mice. ARA improves memory deficits in AD transgenic mice.Figure 8ARA improves memory deficits in AD transgenic mice.

Animal movement was tracked and recorded by ANY-maze tracking software.

GSK3 is involved in tau hyperphosphorylation (65), neuronal apoptosis (66), and synaptic dysfunction (67). Moreover, GSK3 signaling has also been implicated in A\u03b2 production and neuritic plaque formation (51, 54, 68). However, the mechanism by which GSK3 affects APP processing and A\u03b2 production has not been clearly elucidated, and its pharmaceutical potential as an effective drug target remains to be validated. The current study clearly indicates that GSK3\u03b2, but not the related GSK3\u03b1 isoform, facilitates A\u03b2 production by upregulating BACE1 gene expression via NF-\u03baB p65 cis-acting elements on the BACE1 gene promoter. The C-terminal end of BACE1 undergoes phosphorylation, which regulates BACE1 trafficking and cellular levels (69, 70). In our study, inhibition of GSK3 signaling did not affect the phosphorylation status of BACE1 (data not shown). Thus, specifically inhibiting GSK3 decreases BACE1 expression and markedly reduces \u03b2-secretase processing of APP and A\u03b2 production, resulting in inhibition of neuritic plaque formation and amelioration of memory deficits in AD model mice. GSK3 appears to be a common molecular link between amyloidogenesis and tau abnormalities in AD pathology. Therefore, GSK3 inhibition has been proposed to be a valid therapeutic target for treating AD. Lithium chloride and valproic acid are known to have some inhibitory effects on GSK3 (71, 72) and have been used in the clinic for many decades for the treatment of bipolar disorders and epilepsy. Recent work has demonstrated that lithium and valproic acid could reduce A\u03b2 levels and improve cognitive performance in mouse models of AD (54, 68). While the inhibitory effects of lithium and valproic acid on GSK3 are known, both compounds have also been found to affect signaling cascades independent of GSK3. To further investigate the role of GSK3 on APP processing, we administered ARA, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of GSK3 (IC50 = 104 \u00b1 27 nM) (73) to APP Swedish stable cell lines and APP23/PS45 mice. We found that with specific GSK3 inhibition, the BACE1 major product C99 is reduced, accompanied by a significant reduction in A\u03b2 levels. Previous reports indicated that ARA treatment reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and tangle formation in transgenic mice overexpressing human tau, a model of AD (62). Our study shows that ARA also reduces plaque pathology and rescues cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model. However, continuous ARA treatment is required in order to reduce plaque pathology, as APP23/PS45 mice sacrificed 3 months after the last injection had plaque levels similar to those in the control group. Previous work by Phiel et al. (51) demonstrated that inhibition of GSK3\u03b1 with isoform-specific siRNA decreases \u03b3-secretase activity but found no effect of GSK3\u03b2. In our study, we found that in a system in which \u03b3-secretase activity is pharmacologically inhibited, GSK3\u03b1 knockdown did not have any significant effect on APP processing. On the other hand, GSK3\u03b2 knockdown with inhibition of \u03b3-secretase activity reduced the level of C99 fragment, indicating that BACE1 activity is affected. We further provided evidence that knocking down GSK3\u03b2 reduced BACE1 mRNA levels, but knocking down GSK3\u03b1 did not affect BACE1 expression. Previous genetic studies have found that during development GSK3\u03b1 could not compensate for the loss of GSK3\u03b2, as Gsk3b-KO mice are embryonic lethal while Gsk3a-KO mice are viable (61). This argues that GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 isoforms may have distinct cellular functions with respect to BACE1 expression. Moreover, GSK3\u03b2 is the predominant isoform in the brain and therefore has been implicated in many CNS disorders (74). However, Jaworski et al. recently showed the GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 knockout mice did not show any changes to APP processing and A\u03b2 production (52). This could be due to a physiological compensation of BACE1 expression in the KO mice compared with the acute effect of the GSK3 inhibitor. Additionally, our data showed that GSK3\u03b2 regulated NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated BACE1 expression. Gsk3a knockout had no effect on NF-\u03baB signaling. Taken together, these studies suggest that GSK3 isoforms have distinct roles in regulating APP processing. We do not believe that gene silencing of GSK3 isoforms would be a valid approach for treating AD. Complete ablation of each isoform may lead to compensatory elevated activity of the other isoform or even other functionally protein kinases. Moreover, it has been reported that complete ablation of GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 expression in mice results in various abnormalities (75), which may interfere with any therapeutic values. Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested a significant inflammatory component in AD (76\u201379). However, it remains controversial whether neuroinflammation is a driving force for AD or simply a byproduct of the disease (80). Moreover, the detrimental role of astrocyte and microglia during neuroinflammation remains elusive. The release of various proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines has been shown to affect APP processing, A\u03b2 production, and neurodegenerative changes in AD brains. There have been preclinical studies to show that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or anti-inflammatory cytokines have beneficial effects in treating AD (80, 81). However, there are reports demonstrating that anti-inflammatory stimuli could potentiate A\u03b2 production, possibly through suppression of glia-mediated A\u03b2 clearance. On the other hand, proinflammatory stimuli could also have extreme effects on AD pathogenesis. There is a large amount of evidence to show that increased proinflammatory cytokines correlates with A\u03b2 production and neurodegeneration. In contrast, there are also a number of studies indicating that proinflammatory cytokines precondition the system for A\u03b2 challenge and protect against neurodegeneration (82\u201385). Clearly, inflammation is a major component of the AD brain, and more work will be required in order to elucidate its role in AD pathogenesis. Since several proinflammatory cytokines including the interleukins and TNF have been found to activate GSK3\u03b2, and GSK3 inhibitors showed anti-inflammatory effects (86\u201388), we speculate that GSK3 plays an important role in the inflammatory response driving A\u03b2 production. The chronic inflammatory response induced by A\u03b2 may depend on transcription factors to exert neurodegenerative effects. Regulation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and its transcriptional activity may in part play a role in A\u03b2-mediated neurodegeneration (27, 89). It has been previously reported that the BACE1 promoter contains NF-\u03baB\u2013binding elements (27, 90) and exacerbated A\u03b2 levels modulate the BACE1 promoter activity via NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent pathways (91). More recently, Chen et al. (27) found increased NF-\u03baB p65 and BACE1 expression in postmortem AD brains. Furthermore, overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 was found to increase human BACE1 promoter activity, whereas inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling reduced BACE1 expression (27). Exogenous application of A\u03b2 has been found to increase GSK3\u03b2 activity and NF-\u03baB levels. There are many reports suggesting that GSK3\u03b2 regulates gene transcription in an NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent manner (61, 92, 93). Therefore, we argue that the GSK3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is involved in regulating BACE1 gene transcription. In this study, we found that interfering with GSK3\u03b2 activity using Gsk3b-KO cells or ARA treatment reduced BACE1 promoter activity and gene expression. Moreover, disrupting NF-\u03baB expression also blocked GSK3\u03b2-induced BACE1 transcription. Long-term treatment with GSK3 inhibitors always raises the concern about unwanted side effects. Many of the Wnt signal transduction components such as the APC gene or \u03b2-catenin gene carry mutations that render the protein nondegradable (94). Prolonged activation of the Wnt pathway has been linked to development of various cancers (95). GSK3 inhibitors including SB216763, SB415286, Kenpaullone, and lithium chloride have all been shown to elevate the level of \u03b2-catenin (51, 96, 97). Consequently, it may be possible that GSK3 inhibitors may mimic Wnt signaling and could potentially be oncogenic. However, long-term use of lithium chloride to treat bipolar disorder has not been linked to increased risk of cancer. Interestingly, administration of the GSK3 inhibitors CHIR99021 and ARA did not change \u03b2-catenin levels (65). Moreover, \u03b2-catenin levels are largely unaffected in Gsk3b-KO embryos (61). These findings indicate that the inhibition of GSK3 by itself might not be sufficient to elevate the level of \u03b2-catenin. It is possible that there are specific pools of GSK3 that are insensitive to certain GSK3 inhibitors, thereby sparing the effect of increasing \u03b2-catenin levels. In order to validate the therapeutic efficacy of GSK3 inhibition, while minimizing oncogenic side effects, long-term treatment studies in cells and animals will be required. In conclusion, we have found that the GSK3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway regulates BACE1 transcription and thereby facilitates A\u03b2 production in AD. Since GSK3\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB are involved in AD pathogenesis, our results suggest that direct interference of this pathway may be a promising drug target for AD therapy.

Gsk3b-KO fibroblast cells were derived from E12.5 Gsk3b-KO mouse embryos and were maintained in complete DMEM (61). The 20E2 cell line is a Swedish mutant APP695 stable HEK293 cell line cultured in complete DMEM with 50 \u03bcg/ml geneticin (98). 293B2 cells stably expressing human BACE1 in HEK293 cell line were cultured in complete DMEM with 100 \u03bcg/ml Zeocin (99). The RelA-KO fibroblast cell line, derived from E12.5\u2013E14.5 mouse embryo fibroblasts, was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and ESGRO (LIF) (100). S9A-GSK3\u03b2 stably transfected SHSY5Y cells, under the control of the tetracycline-regulated mammalian expression T-Rex system (Invitrogen), were maintained in complete DMEM (60). S9A-GSK3\u03b2 gene induction was achieved by stimulation with 1 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline (60). Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using either calcium phosphate or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). L685,458, G2, and ARA (EMD Biosciences) were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with complete cell culture medium. The final DMSO concentrations in each experiment were less than 0.5%. Luciferase assay. BACE1 promoter constructs were transfected into N2a cells and wild-type and Gsk3b-KO MEFs. The Renilla (sea pansy) luciferase vector pCMV-Rluc was co-transfected to normalize transfection efficiency. A luciferase assay was performed 48 hours after transfection with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) as previously described (27). Semiquantitative RT-PCR. RNA was isolated from cells using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). A Thermoscript Reverse Transcription kit (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA from an equal amount of RNA following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The newly synthesized cDNA templates were further amplified via Platinum Taq DNA polymerase in a 20-\u03bcl reaction. The following primers were used to specifically amplify BACE1, GSK3A, GSK3B, APP, and PS1 genes: BACE1 forward 5\u2032-cccgcagacgctcaacatcc and reverse 5\u2032-GCCACTGTCCACAATGCTCTT; GSK3A forward 5\u2032-TGAAGCTGGGCCGTGACAGCGG and reverse 5\u2032-ACATGTACACCTTGACATAG; GSK3B forward 5\u2032-TCAGGAGTGCGGGTCTTCCGAC and reverse 5\u2032-CTCCAGTATTAGCATCTGACGCT; APP forward 5\u2032-GCTGGCCTGCTGGCTGAACC and reverse 5\u2032-GGCGACGGTGTGCCAGTGAA; PS1 forward 5\u2032-GAGACACAGGACAGTGGTTCTGG and reverse 5\u2032-GGCCGATCAGTATGGCTACAAA. \u03b2-Actin was used as an internal control. The samples were resolved and analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel. Immunoblot analysis. Brain tissues or cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 4% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) supplemented with 200 mM sodium orthovanadate, 25 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM PMSF, and a complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche Diagnostics). The samples were diluted in 4\u00d7 SDS-sample buffer, boiled, and resolved on 12% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE or 16% Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvindylidine fluoride (PVDF-FL) membranes. For immunoblot analysis, membranes were blocked for 1 hour in PBS containing 5% nonfat dried milk, followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C in primary antibodies diluted in the blocking medium. Rabbit anti-APP C-terminal polyclonal antibody C20 was used to detect APP and its CTF products. PS1 was detected by anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody 231. Total GSK3\u03b2 was determined using a pan-specific mouse anti-GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 antibody (BioSource International Inc.). Total \u03b2-catenin was determined using a pan-specific rabbit anti\u2013\u03b2-catenin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). The NF-\u03baB p65 subunit was determined using mouse anti-p65 (Sigma-Aldrich). Internal control \u03b2-actin was analyzed using monoclonal antibody AC-15 (Sigma-Aldrich). BACE1 was detected with the anti-BACE1 antibody 208 recognizing the C-terminal end (101). A\u03b240/42 ELISA. HEK293 cells stably expressing the human APP gene containing the Swedish mutation were maintained in cell culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS. Following ARA treatment for 24 hours, conditioned medium was harvested, and protease inhibitors and AEBSF (Roche Diagnostics) were added to prevent degradation of A\u03b2 peptides. APP23/PS45 double transgenic mouse cortical tissues were prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions prior to carrying out the ELISA protocol (Invitrogen). The concentration of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 were detected using an A\u03b21\u201340 or A\u03b21\u201342 Colorimetric ELISA kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. EMSA. Whole brain extracts were prepared by homogenizing the tissue in Buffer C (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitor. EMSA was performed as previously described with a few changes (102). Briefly, 20\u201340 \u03bcg protein was incubated with an IRDye 700\u2013labeled NF-\u03baB oligo (5\u2032-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC), and the gels were scanned using the Odyssey system (LI-COR Biosciences). In the competition assay, unlabeled wild-type and mutant (5\u2032-AGTTGAGGCCACTTTCCCAGGC) NF-\u03baB oligos at \u00d710 and \u00d7100 molar excess were used to compete for binding. Transgenic mice and drug treatment. APP23 mice overexpressing the Swedish APP751 (KM\u2192NL) mutant transgene driven by the mouse Thy1.2 promoter were originally generated at Novartis Pharma as previously described (30, 103). APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice were generated by crossing APP23 mice with mice overexpressing the human G384A-mutated PS1 under the control of the murine Thy1 promoter (B6,D2-TgN(Thy1-PS1G384A)45) (54, 103\u2013105). APP23 and PS45 mice had been backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice for more than 7 generations prior to breeding for the double transgenic mice. The genotype of the mice was confirmed by PCR using DNA from tail tissues. The treatment group contained 14 animals (8 females, 6 males), and the sham-injected group contained 12 animals (7 females, 5 males). The treatment group received 5 mg/kg ARA diluted in 0.9% saline daily via intraperitoneal injection at the same time each day. Mice in the control group were injected with the vehicle solution containing DMSO diluted in 0.9% saline only. We tabulated the daily food consumption and weight for each mouse. Immunohistochemical staining. Mice were sacrificed after behavioral testing, and half brains were immediately homogenized for protein, RNA, or DNA extraction. The other halves of the brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned with a Leica Cryostat to 30-\u03bcm thickness. Every twelfth slice with the same reference position was mounted onto slides for staining. Immunocytochemical staining was performed on floating sections. The plaques in the sections were detected with biotinylated monoclonal 4G8 antibody (Signetlabs) in 1:500 dilution, visualized by the ABC and DAB method, and counted under a \u00d740 objective as previously described (54, 63). Plaques were quantified, and the average plaque count per slice was recorded for each mouse. Thioflavin-S staining of plaques was performed with 1% thioflavin-S visualized using fluorescence microscopy (54). Morris water maze test. The Morris water maze test was performed as previously described (30, 64). The APP23/PS45 mice treated with or without ARA were subjected to the Morris water maze test 1 day after the last injection regimen. The test was performed in a 1.5-meter-diameter pool with a 10-cm-diameter platform placed in the SE quadrant of the pool. The procedure consisted of 1 day of visible platform tests and 4 days of hidden platform tests, plus a probe trial 24 hours after the last hidden platform test. In the visible platform test performed on the first day, the mice were tested for 5 continuous trials, with an inter-trial interval of 60 minutes. In the hidden platform tests, mice were trained for 5 trials, with an inter-trial interval of 1 hour. Each mouse was allowed 60 seconds to search for the platform. In the scenario where the mouse could not locate the platform, the experiment guided it to the platform and allowed the mouse to rest there for 15 seconds. On the last day of the test, each mouse was subjected to the probe trial in which the platform was removed. Each mouse was given 60 seconds to locate where the platform was originally placed. Mouse behavior including distance traveled, escape latency and the number of passes through the platform was recorded by automated video tracking (ANY-maze, Stoelting). The data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. Statistics. All results were presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and analyzed by ANOVA or 2-tailed Student\u2019s t-test. Statistical significance is accepted when P < 0.05. Study approval. Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the University of British Columbia Animal Care and Use Committee and Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) guidelines.Supplemental dataView Supplemental dataAcknowledgmentsWe thank Steven R.

First published December 3, 2012Received for publication April 26, 2012, and accepted in revised form September 27, 2012.Deposition of amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) to form neuritic plaques in the brain is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). A\u03b2 is generated from sequential cleavages of the \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases, and \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the \u03b2-secretase essential for A\u03b2 generation. Previous studies have indicated that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) may play a role in APP processing by modulating \u03b3-secretase activity, thereby facilitating A\u03b2 production. There are two highly conserved isoforms of GSK3: GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2. We now report that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production by decreasing BACE1 gene transcription and expression. The regulation of BACE1 gene expression by GSK3\u03b2 was dependent on NF-\u03baB signaling. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling markedly reduced A\u03b2 deposition and neuritic plaque formation, and rescued memory deficits in the double transgenic AD model mice. These data provide evidence for regulation of BACE1 expression and AD pathogenesis by GSK3\u03b2 and that inhibition of GSK3 signaling can reduce A\u03b2 neuropathology and alleviate memory deficits in AD model mice. Our study suggests that interventions that specifically target the \u03b2-isoform of GSK3 may be a safe and effective approach for treating AD. IntroductionAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia. The characteristic neuropathological features of AD include neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2), the central component of neuritic plaques, is produced from sequential endoproteolytic cleavages of the type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase. Proteolytic processing of APP at the \u03b2 site is essential for generating A\u03b2, and \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the \u03b2-secretase in vivo (1\u20134). BACE1 cleaves APP at two \u03b2-sites, Asp+1 and Glu+11 of the A\u03b2 domain, to generate C99 and C89 fragment, respectively (5). Subsequently, \u03b3-secretase cleaves C99 within its transmembrane domain to release A\u03b2 and APP C-terminal fragment \u03b3 (CTF\u03b3). In addition to APP, BACE1 substrates also include other proteins: LRP (6), APLP1 (7), APLP2 (8), ST6Gal I (9), and PSGL-1 (10). BACE1 expression is tightly regulated at the level of transcription (5, 11, 12) and translation (13\u201316). It was reported that a G/C polymorphism in exon 5 of the BACE1 gene might be associated with some sporadic cases of AD (17\u201319). Although genetic analyses from our and other laboratories have failed to uncover any mutation in the BACE1 coding sequence or any disease-associated SNP in its promoter region in AD patients (20\u201322), increased \u03b2-secretase levels and activity have been reported in AD (23\u201327). BACE1 levels were elevated in neurons around plaques (28). BACE1 mRNA levels tended to increase as miR-107 levels decreased in the progression of AD (29). We reported that hypoxia, a common vascular component among AD risk factors, increased BACE1 expression, resulting in both increased A\u03b2 deposition and memory deficits in AD transgenic mice (30). Recently we found that both NF-\u03baB and BACE1 levels were increased in sporadic AD patients, and NF-\u03baB facilitated BACE1 gene expression and APP processing (27). Thus, increased BACE1 expression by NF-\u03baB signaling in the brain could be one of the mechanisms underlying AD development (27). Together, these studies indicate that BACE1 dysregulation plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. BACE1 has been considered as one of the major targets for AD drug development. Bace1-knockout mice have abolished A\u03b2 generation (31\u201333). Suppression of BACE1 by RNA interference reduced APP processing and A\u03b2 production in primary cortical neurons derived from both wild-type and Swedish APP mutant transgenic mice (34), and disruption of the Bace1 gene rescued memory deficits and cholinergic dysfunction in Swedish APP mice (35). Oral administration of a potent and selective BACE1 inhibitor decreased \u03b2-cleavage and A\u03b2 production in APP transgenic mice in vivo (36). Bace1-KO mice were reported to display hypomyelination of peripheral nerves and aberrant axonal segregation (37, 38), suggesting that inhibiting \u03b2-secretase may have unwanted collateral effects. However, even a partial reduction in BACE1 can have dramatically beneficial effects on AD pathology (39), suggesting that therapeutic inhibition of BACE1 is a valid therapeutic target for AD treatment. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinase originally identified as playing an important role in glycogen metabolism. Since its discovery, many studies have shown that GSK3 has pleiotropic functions, including embryonic development, gene transcription, and neuronal cell function (40). In mammals, two GSK3 isoforms are encoded by distinct genes: GSK3A produces a 51-kDa GSK3\u03b1 protein and GSK3B a 47-kDa GSK3\u03b2 protein (41). These two isoforms are highly homologous, sharing greater than 95% amino acid identity in the catalytic domains. Although both isoforms are ubiquitously expressed, the \u03b2 isoform is expressed at higher levels in neuronal tissues (42). GSK3 activity is regulated at several levels. Phosphorylation of Tyr279/Tyr216 on GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 is important for enzymatic activity (43). Inactivation of GSK3 can be achieved through phosphorylation of Ser21/Ser9 residues within the N-terminal domain on GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2, respectively. Stimulation of tissues by insulin and growth factors activates the PI3K/PKB/Akt signal transduction cascade, leading to phosphorylation of these inhibitory serine residues (44, 45). GSK3 is also regulated upon interaction of the Wnt ligand and its receptor Frizzled and co-receptor LRP5/6. This interaction releases GSK3 from a multi-protein complex formed by \u03b2-catenin, axin, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (46, 47), which prevents GSK3-mediated \u03b2-catenin degradation and induces \u03b2-catenin\u2013dependent gene transcription. Dysregulation of GSK3 activity has been implicated in AD. Increased GSK3\u03b2 activity was found in postmortem AD brains (48). GSK3\u03b2 has been found to phosphorylate the tau protein on various conserved sites and contribute to tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation (49, 50). GSK3\u03b1 was reported to regulate A\u03b2 production by positively modulating the \u03b3-secretase complex (51), although this finding has recently been challenged (52). Inhibition of GSK3 activity with the commonly known GSK3 inhibitors LiCl and valproic acid in cell culture (53) and animal models of AD decreased A\u03b2 production (51, 54). Although LiCl and valproic acid are known to inhibit GSK3 activity, these compounds also activate a plethora of signaling cascades that could differentially regulate APP processing independent of GSK3 (55\u201358). In this study, we examined the effects of GSK3\u03b2-specific inhibition on AD neuropathology and behavioral deficits and identified its underlying mechanism. We found that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP. Treatment with the GSK3 inhibitor AR-A014418 (ARA) reduced neuritic plaque formation and alleviated memory deficits in AD transgenic model mice. Furthermore, we found that GSK3\u03b2 regulated BACE1 transcription via NF-\u03baB signaling. Our work provides evidence that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 may be an effective therapeutic approach for treating AD. ResultsRegulation of \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production by GSK3 signaling. Previous studies showed that LiCl and valproic acid modulated GSK3 signaling and reduced A\u03b2 production (51, 54). However, the underlying mechanism is not well defined, and these compounds also have many confounding GSK3-independent effects. To examine the specific effect of GSK3 signaling on APP processing, we applied ARA, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of GSK3, to 20E2 cells, a stable cell line expressing human Swedish mutant APP (5). ARA at 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM significantly decreased the levels of the \u03b2-secretase cleavage product APP C99 to 95.7% \u00b1 1.6%, 66.4% \u00b1 0.7%, and 31.3% \u00b1 0.4%, respectively (P < 0.001 by 1-way ANOVA) (Figure 1A and B). The treatment had no significant effect on APP expression (Figure 1A). The A\u03b2 ELISA was performed to assess the levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 in the conditioned media of 20E2 cells. ARA markedly reduced A\u03b2 generation in a dose-dependent manner. A\u03b240 was decreased to 99.2% \u00b1 3.8%, 73.2% \u00b1 4.6%, and 48.7% \u00b1 1.3% with 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM of ARA treatment, respectively (P < 0.05) (Figure 1C); and A\u03b242 was reduced to 99.2% \u00b1 3.1%, 73.2% \u00b1 3.5%, and 48.7% \u00b1 4.5% with 1, 2.5 and 5 \u03bcM of ARA treatment, respectively (P < 0.01 by 1-way ANOVA) (Figure 1D). As expected, inhibition of GSK3 stabilized \u03b2-catenin (Figure 1A), and ARA treatment resulted in a significant increase in \u03b2-catenin levels to 152.7% \u00b1 11.1%, 221.3% \u00b1 17.0%, and 233.7% \u00b1 25.0% with 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM, respectively (P < 0.05). These data indicate that specifically inhibiting GSK3 reduced BACE1-mediated APP processing and C99 and A\u03b2 production. Specific inhibition of GSK3 reduces BACE1 cleavage of APP.Figure 1Specific inhibition of GSK3 reduces BACE1 cleavage of APP. (A) Swedish mutant APP stable cell line 20E2 was cultured and treated with ARA for 24 hours, and cell lysates subjected to Western blot analysis. Full-length APP and the APP CTFs were detected with C20 antibody. \u03b2-Catenin was detected by anti\u2013\u03b2-catenin antibody. \u03b2-Actin was detected by anti-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control. (B) Quantification of APP C99 generation in 20E2 cells. ARA treatment significantly increased \u03b2-catenin levels in a dose-dependent manner, while APP C99 production decreased with increasing ARA dosage. n = 6; *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, ANOVA. A\u03b2 ELISA detection of A\u03b240 (C) and A\u03b242 (D) in conditioned medium from 20E2 cells treated with ARA for 24 hours. ARA treatment reduced A\u03b2 levels in the conditioned medium in a dose-dependent manner. The values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, ANOVA. (E) \u03b3-Secretase activity in 20E2 cells was inhibited by the pharmacological inhibitor L685,458 (GSI). Co-treatment with specific GSK3 inhibitors ARA and G2 reduced C99. Con, control. (F) Quantification of C99 levels. n = 6; *P < 0.05, ANOVA. To further examine the effect of GSK3 on \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production, we pharmacologically blocked \u03b3-secretase activity with the \u03b3-secretase\u2013specific inhibitor L658,458 in 20E2 cells while co-treating with the GSK3 inhibitor ARA and G2. G2 is another structurally distinct GSK3 inhibitor, with an IC50 of 304 nM (59). As expected, \u03b3-secretase inhibition resulted in markedly increased generation of the APP CTFs C83 and C99 (Figure 1E). Addition of ARA or G2 reduced C99 levels to 78.2% \u00b1 1.1% and 63.9% \u00b1 6.6% (Figure 1, E and F). ARA treatment had no significant effect on Notch cleavage (Supplemental Figure 1B; supplemental material available online with this article; doi: 10.1172/JCI64516DS1). These data demonstrated that specific inhibition of GSK3 reduced \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP to generate C99 and A\u03b2 production in cells. GSK3\u03b2 but not GSK3\u03b1 regulates BACE1 gene expression and BACE1-mediated APP processing. Our study has shown that GSK3 regulated \u03b2-secretase processing of APP, an essential step for A\u03b2 generation. Since BACE1 is the \u03b2-secretase in vivo, we first examined whether GSK3 affects BACE1 gene expression. GSK3 has two highly homologous isoforms, GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2. We used RNA interference to specifically knock down the expression of GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 isoforms in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to determine whether both isoforms or one of the isoforms play a major role in regulating BACE1 gene expression. Specific knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 expression by the siRNA significantly reduced BACE1 mRNA levels to 76.0% \u00b1 6.6% as compared with control (P < 0.05) (Figure 2, A and B), whereas knockdown of GSK3\u03b1 did not affect BACE1 mRNA expression (P > 0.05) (Figure 2, A and B). Additional exogenous expression of GSK3\u03b2 rescued the reduction of BACE1 expression resulting from knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 by siRNA (Supplemental Figure 2). To examine whether specific knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 expression also affected \u03b2-secretase processing of APP, we transfected siRNA specific to GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 into 20E2 cells while inhibiting \u03b3-secretase activity with L658,458. Western blotting showed that GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 siRNA specifically reduced GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 expression, respectively (Figure 2C). Knockdown of GSK3\u03b1 expression did not significantly affect BACE1-mediated APP processing, whereas GSK3\u03b2 knockdown reduced the production of the BACE1 cleavage product C99 to 51.9% \u00b1 6.4% (P < 0.05) (Figure 2, C and D). GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, regulates BACE1 gene expression and APP processing.Figure 2GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, regulates BACE1 gene expression and APP processing. (A) SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were transfected with scrambled GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 isoform\u2013specific siRNA. RNA was extracted, and semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed to measure endogenous human BACE1, GSK3A, GSK3B, and \u03b2-actin mRNA levels with specific primers recognizing the coding sequence of each gene. PCR products after 28 cycles were analyzed on 1.2% agarose gel. (B) Endogenous BACE1 mRNA was significantly reduced with GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, isoform\u2013specific knockdown. The values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 3; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. (C) 20E2 cells were transfected with scrambled or GSK3\u03b1, or GSK3\u03b2 isoform\u2013specific siRNA while cotreated with L685,458 to block \u03b3-secretase activity. Full-length APP and CTF fragments were detected with C20 antibody. GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 were detected using a monoclonal GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 antibody. GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 isoforms were selectively reduced by the isoform-specific siRNA. \u03b2-Actin served as an internal control and was detected using a monoclonal anti\u2013\u03b2-actin antibody, AC-15. (D) GSK3\u03b2-specific knockdown significantly reduced C99 levels. GSK3\u03b1-specific knockdown did not have any significant effect. The values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. (E) Tetracycline-regulated SHSY5Y cells were induced to express constitutively active S9A-GSK3\u03b2. Endogenous human BACE1 mRNA levels were assessed as described above. Tetracyline-induced S9A-GSK3\u03b2 significantly increased BACE1 expression. (F) Quantification of the endogenous BACE1 mRNA level. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. To further confirm that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene expression at the transcription level, we assayed BACE1 mRNA in the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 inducible SHSY5Y stable cell line. This stable cell line carries the constitutively active mutant GSK3\u03b2, and expression of the mutant gene is under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (60). Addition of tetracycline induced the expression of active GSK3\u03b2 (Figure 2E) and resulted in significantly increased expression of BACE1 to 251.1% \u00b1 70.0% relative to the control (P < 0.05) (Figure 2F). These data demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, specifically regulates BACE1 gene expression and contribute to APP processing. GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene promoter activity. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 gene expression at the transcription level, we performed a BACE1 gene promoter assay. Two human BACE1 gene promoter deletion plasmids were constructed. Regions of the BACE1 promoter from \u20132890 to +292 bp (pB1-A) and from \u20139 to +292 bp (pB1-B) were inserted into promoterless vector pGL3-basic upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Figure 3A). To examine the effect of GSK3 on BACE1 gene promoter activity, we transfected N2a cells with pB1-A and then treated them with ARA. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling by ARA significantly decreased the promoter activity of pB1-A in N2a cells to 54.9% \u00b1 6.2% (P < 0.005) (Figure 3B). To further investigate the underlying mechanism and determine the BACE1 promoter region that mediates the transcriptional activation by GSK3 signaling, we co-transfected N2a cells with either pB1-A or pB1-B plasmid together with the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 plasmid, which carries a constitutively active form of GSK3\u03b2. Expression of active GSK3\u03b2 markedly increased the luciferase activity of pB1-A in the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 transfected cells to 144.0% \u00b1 2.0% as compared with the control (P < 0.05), but had no significant effect on the luciferase activity of pB1-B (P > 0.05) (Figure 3C). This result showed that enhancing GSK3\u03b2 signaling upregulated BACE1 gene promoter activity and the 2.8-kb promoter region is responsible for GSK3\u03b2-mediated upregulation of BACE1 transcription. To further confirm this finding, we transfected these two deletion promoter plasmids into Gsk3b-KO or wild-type cells. Ablation of Gsk3b expression in the Gsk3b-KO cells resulted in significant reduction in luciferase activity of pB1-A to 47.0% \u00b1 7.5% as compared with the wild-type control cells (P < 0.01) (Figure 3D). However, knockout of the Gsk3b gene had no significant effect on the luciferase activity of pB1-B (Figure 3D). Taken together, these results demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene expression via its effect on the BACE1 promoter. GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 promoter activation.Figure 3GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 promoter activation. (A) Schematic of the 3.3-kb (pB1-A) and 300-bp (pB1-B) human BACE1 promoter/luciferase construct. (B) The 3.5-kb human BACE1 promoter was transfected into N2a cells and treated with 5 \u03bcM ARA. GSK3 inhibition with ARA treatment resulted in a significant decrease in luciferase activity. (C) N2a cells were co-transfected with either promoter constructs and S9A-GSK3\u03b2 or a vector control. S9A-GSK3\u03b2 significantly increased the luciferase activity of the 3.3-kb BACE1 promoter construct but did not have any effect on the 300-bp promoter construct. (D) pB1-A or pB1-B constructs were transfected into Gsk3b-KO MEFs. pB1-A had significantly reduced promoter activity. All promoter data shown represent an average of at least 4 independent experiments, with each condition performed in triplicate. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005, Student\u2019s t test. NF-\u03baB mediates the transcriptional regulation of BACE1 gene expression by GSK3\u03b2. Recently we reported that levels of both BACE1 and NF-\u03baB are increased in AD brains, and NF-\u03baB signaling upregulates human BACE1 gene expression by acting on the cis-acting p65-binding element in its promoter (27). Previous studies in Gsk3b-KO mice demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2 is required for proper activation of NF-\u03baB (61). As our data indicate that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene transcription, we next examined whether regulation of BACE1 transcription by GSK3\u03b2 signaling is dependent on NF-\u03baB. TNF-\u03b1 is a strong activator of NF-\u03baB p65 expression. In order to examine the specific role of NF-\u03baB in GSK3\u03b2-regulated BACE1 transcription, we transfected N2a cells with a pBACE1-4\u03baB promoter plasmid that contained only the NF-\u03baB\u2013binding elements in the human BACE1 promoter (27). After transfection, the cells were cotreated with TNF-\u03b1 and the GSK3 inhibitor ARA. ARA treatment alone consistently reduced BACE1 promoter activity (Figure 4A). TNF-\u03b1 stimulation increased pB1A promoter activity to 132.6% \u00b1 7.5% of the control (P < 0.01). However, ARA treatment reduced the TNF-\u03b1\u2013induced BACE1 promoter activation to 115.6 \u00b1 6.9% as compared with TNF-\u03b1 treatment alone (P < 0.05) (Figure 4A). Overexpression of p65 NF-\u03baB significantly increased the BACE1 promoter activity to 487.1% \u00b1 102.2% as compared with the control (P < 0.001) (Figure 3D). However, ARA did not affect NF-\u03baB p65\u2019s upregulating effect on BACE1 promoter activity (P > 0.05), indicating that GSK3 signaling may have its effect upstream of NF-\u03baB in the modulation of BACE1 transcription (Figure 4B). To further confirm ARA\u2019s effect on NF-\u03baB activity, we co-transfected N2a cells with pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc and NF-\u03baB p65 or an empty vector, followed by treatment with ARA to inhibit GSK3 signaling. ARA reduced pNF-\u03baB-Luc promoter activity to 51.9% \u00b1 9.1% as compared with control (P < 0.05) (Figure 4C). Overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 significantly increased pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc promoter activity to 203.36 \u00b1 87.38\u2013fold (P < 0.001) (Figure 4C). Additional ARA treatment did not have any significant effect on the transcriptional activation of pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc by NF-\u03baB p65 overexpression (P > 0.05) (Figure 4C). These data indicate that the p65-binding elements in the BACE1 promoter mediated the effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 transcription. GSK3\u03b2 regulation of BACE1 transcription is dependent on NF-\u03baB p65 expressioFigure 4GSK3\u03b2 regulation of BACE1 transcription is dependent on NF-\u03baB p65 expression. (A) pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB plasmid contains the 4 NF-\u03baB cis-elements from the human BACE1 promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. N2a cells were co-transfected with pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB and pCMV-RLuc. Transfected cells were treated with vehicle solution (control) or 10 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 with/without 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours. (B) N2a cells were co-transfected with pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB plasmid and pMTF-p65 or a vector control. Transfected cells were then treated with a vehicle solution or 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours. (C) pNF-\u03baB-Luc was co-transfected with pMTF-p65 or a vector control and treated with a vehicle solution or 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours. Renilla luciferase was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, Student\u2019s t test. (D) Wild-type MEFs and RelA-KO MEFs which are dysfunctional for NF-\u03baB activity, were co-transfected with a 3.5-kb human BACE1 promoter and S9A-GSK3\u03b2 or a control vector. S9A-GSK3\u03b2 overexpression in MEFs. significantly increased luciferase activity (*P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test), whereas RelA-KO MEFs did not have any significant effect. Luciferase activity is indicative of BACE1 promoter activity. All promoter data shown represent an average of at least 4 independent experiments, with each condition performed in triplicate. (E) N2a cells were treated with 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours, followed by cell fractionation. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. ARA treatment significantly reduced NF-\u03baB p65 levels in the (F) nuclear fraction (n = 6; **P < 0.001, Student\u2019s t test) and (G) cytosolic fraction. n = 6; ***P < 0.001, Student\u2019s t test. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. To confirm the role of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in GSK3\u03b2-mediated BACE1 transcription, we transfected NF-\u03baB p65 knockout RelA-KO cells and wild-type control cells with the BACE1 promoter pB1-A and the constitutively active GSK3\u03b2 expression plasmid S9A-GSK3\u03b2. In wild-type cells, activation of GSK3\u03b2 signaling by expression of S9A-GSK3\u03b2 markedly increased BACE1 promoter activity to 189.6% \u00b1 20.9% as compared with the vector control (P < 0.05), whereas activation of GSK3\u03b2 signaling by expression of S9A-GSK3\u03b2 had no effect on BACE1 promoter activity in RelA-KO cells (P > 0.05) (Figure 4D), indicating that disruption of NF-\u03baB p65 expression in RelA-KO cells abolished GSK3\u03b2\u2019s effect on the transcriptional activation of the human BACE1 gene promoter. To further examine the effect of GSK3 inhibition on NF-\u03baB p65 expression, we treated N2a cells with ARA and subjected them to subcellular fractionation (Figure 4E). ARA treatment significantly reduced nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 levels to 46.9% \u00b1 9.1% as compared with control (P < 0.01) (Figure 4F). Moreover, ARA treatment also reduced cytosolic NF-\u03baB p65 levels to 56.1% \u00b1 7.1% as compared with control (P < 0.001) (Figure 4G). These data show that GSK3 inhibition with ARA reduced NF-\u03baB activity by decreasing NF-\u03baB p65 levels. Taken together, our results demonstrate that NF-\u03baB signaling mediates the regulatory effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 gene expression. GSK3 regulates BACE1 gene expression, APP processing, and A\u03b2 production in vivo. Our data provide strong evidence that GSK3\u03b2 activates BACE1 gene expression, resulting in enhanced \u03b2-secretase processing of APP and A\u03b2 production in vitro. To examine the effect of GSK3 signaling on BACE1 gene expression and APP processing in vivo, we first assayed APP CTFs and A\u03b2 production in the brain of APP23/PS45 mice by Western blot analysis (Figure 5, A and B). APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice, an AD mouse model, were generated by crossing APP23 mice, carrying the human Swedish mutant APP751 transgene driven by the neuron-specific Thy1.2 promoter, and PS45 mice, carrying the human familial AD\u2013associated G384A mutant presenilin-1 (PS1) (54). The mice were treated with 5 mg/kg of the GSK3 inhibitor ARA at 6 weeks of age daily for 4 weeks, while age-matched control mice received vehicle solution. ARA treatment significantly decreased the brain levels of the \u03b2-secretase\u2013generated CTF\u03b2 fragments C99 and C89, to 38.4% \u00b1 4.8% relative to controls (P < 0.05) (Figure 5B). The levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 were reduced to 71.2% \u00b1 8.3% and 65.6% \u00b1 11.0% in ARA-treated mice relative to controls, (P < 0.05) (Figure 5, C and D). These data demonstrate that inhibition of GSK3 activity by ARA treatment reduces \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo. ARA inhibits BACE1 cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo.Figure 5ARA inhibits BACE1 cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo. (A) Hemi-brains from ARA-treated and control APP23/PS45 mice of the 6 weeks age group were homogenized in RIPA-Doc lysis buffer and separated with 12% Tris-glycine or 16% Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE. Full-length APP and APP CTFs (C99 and C89) were detected by C20 polyclonal antibody. PS1 was detected by anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody 231. BACE1 was detected by anti-BACE1 antibody. \u03b2-Actin was detected by anti\u2013\u03b2-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control. (B) Quantification showed that CTF\u03b2 was significantly decreased in ARA-treated mice. n = 25 mice total. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, Student\u2019s t test. ELISA was performed to measure A\u03b240 (C) and A\u03b242 (D) levels from the brain tissues of APP23/PS45 mice injected with or without ARA. n = 8 for each group; *P < 0.005, Student\u2019s t test. (E) Total RNA was isolated from APP23/PS45 mouse cortices by TRI Reagent. Sets of gene-specific primers were used to amplify Bace1 (E), PS1 (G), and App (I) genes. \u03b2-Actin was used as an internal control. Bace1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced (F), while there were no difference in endogenous PS1 (H) or App (J) mRNA levels between ARA-treated mice and controls. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 12 total; *P < 0.01, Student\u2019s t test. We then examined whether the level of BACE1 was altered by GSK3 signaling in vivo. Western blot analysis showed that inhibition of GSK3 signaling significantly reduced the protein level of BACE1 to 64.7% \u00b1 7.3% in ARA-treated mice, as compared with the control mice (P < 0.01), and the treatment had no significant effect on APP and PS1 protein levels (P > 0.05) (Figure 5, A and B). We further showed that GSK3 inhibition with ARA reduced tau phosphorylation, which is consistent with previous findings (ref. 62 and Supplemental Figure 1A). Our in vitro study has shown that GSK3\u03b2 regulates the transcription of the BACE1 gene. To confirm that the decrease in BACE1 protein level seen in the brains of the ARA-treated mice was due to reduced BACE1 gene transcription, the endogenous Bace1 mRNA levels were measured (Figure 5, E, G, and I). ARA treatment markedly reduced Bace1 mRNA level to 36.7% \u00b1 11.8% (P < 0.01) (Figure 5F), but did not significantly change the mRNA levels of App and PS1 genes (P > 0.05) (Figure 5, H and J). These data demonstrate that, consistent with the in vitro results, inhibition of GSK3 specifically inhibited Bace1 gene expression and its \u03b2-secretase activity in vivo. Our study has demonstrated that NF-\u03baB signaling is required for GSK3\u03b2\u2019s regulatory effect on BACE1 gene expression in vitro. To confirm this effect in vivo, we examined whether NF-\u03baB activity was affected in APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice administered ARA. EMSA was used to assess NF-\u03baB consensus DNA binding in whole brain lysates. ARA treatment inhibited the binding of NF-\u03baB p65 protein to the cis-acting consensus oligonucleotide probe, resulting in a reduction in the intensity of the p65 NF-\u03baB shifted bands (Figure 6A). The specificity of the bands was confirmed by competition assay with addition of \u00d710 and \u00d7100 unlabeled wild-type NF-\u03baB oligonucleotides (oligos), while the mutant NF-\u03baB oligos did not have any significant effect on the shifted bands (Figure 6B). Consistent with the in vitro experiment, APP23/PS45 mice receiving ARA treatment showed a significant reduction in NF-\u03baB levels to 62.9% \u00b1 6.9% of those in the sham-injected controls (P < 0.005) (Figure 6, C and D). Thus, inhibition of GSK3 signaling attenuates NF-\u03baB binding to cis-acting p65 binding elements by reducing NF-\u03baB levels in the AD transgenic model mice in vivo. ARA reduced NF-\u03baB binding in APP23/PS45 mouse brains.Figure 6ARA reduced NF-\u03baB binding in APP23/PS45 mouse brains.

To examine the specific effect of GSK3 signaling on AD pathogenesis, we treated APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice with ARA. The double transgenic mice develop detectable neuritic plaques in the neocortex and hippocampus as early as 1 month of age. The mice were treated with 5 mg/kg ARA at 6 weeks of age daily for 4 weeks, while age-matched control mice received vehicle solution. 4G8 immunostaining and thioflavin-S staining were used to detect A\u03b2-containing neuritic plaques in the brains (ref. 63 and Figure 7). ARA treatment significantly decreased the number of neuritic plaques in the transgenic mice relative to the vehicle-injected group (Figure 7, A and B). Quantification showed that overall ARA treatment reduced plaque number by approximately 50% (23.8 \u00b1 4.7 vs. 10.4 \u00b1 1.3 per slice, P < 0.01) (Figure 7C). Thioflavin-S staining also confirmed that ARA treatment dramatically reduced the number of A\u03b2-containing neuritic plaques in the brains of APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice (Figure 7, D and E). The inhibitory effect of ARA was reversible, and the treated mice (Figure 7G) had plaque numbers similar to those in the control mice (Figure 7F) when examined 3 months after the end of the drug treatment (36.5 \u00b1 5.1 vs. 32.1 \u00b1 4.2, P > 0.05) (Figure 7H). During the 4-week injection period, ARA treatment of the mice did not affect food consumption, and no significant weight changes were observed between the treatment and control groups (data not shown).

(A and B) APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice at the age of 6 weeks were treated with ARA (5 mg/kg) for 4 weeks, while age-matched control APP23/PS45 mice received vehicle solution. The mice were sacrificed after behavioral tests, and the brains were dissected, fixed, and sectioned. Neuritic plaques were detected using A\u03b2 specific monoclonal antibody 4G8 (Signet).

Inhibition of GSK3 significantly improves memory deficits in the AD model mice. To investigate whether GSK3 inhibition by ARA treatment affects the memory deficit in AD pathogenesis, we used the Morris water maze to test spatial memory after APP23/PS45 mice received 1 month of ARA treatment (64). In the visible platform tests, ARA-treated and control APP23/PS45 mice had similar escape latency (42.4 \u00b1 4.3 and 44.8 \u00b1 2.7 seconds, P > 0.05) (Figure 8A) and path length (6.6 \u00b1 0.7 m and 6.1 \u00b1 0.5 m, P > 0.05) (Figure 8B), indicating that ARA treatment did not affect mouse mobility or vision. In the hidden platform test, ARA-treated mice showed significant improvements as compared with the vehicle-treated controls. The escape latency on the third and fourth days of the hidden platform test was shorter (12.0 \u00b1 1.6 and 17.4 \u00b1 3.1 seconds) than that of sham-treated mice (23.8 \u00b1 4.0 s and 24.9 \u00b1 2.7 s) (P < 0.05, Figure 8C). The ARA-treated mice swam significantly shorter distances to reach the platform (2.9 \u00b1 0.7 m and 3.2 \u00b1 0.3 m) as compared with control mice (3.7 \u00b1 0.6 and 4.2 \u00b1 0.5 m) on the third and fourth days (P < 0.05, Figure 8D). In the probe trial on the last day of testing, the platform was removed. ARA treatment significantly improved the spatial memory in the APP23/PS45 mice, as these mice spent more time searching for the platform in the appropriate quadrant (Supplemental Figure 3A). The number of times the mice traveled into the third quadrant, where the hidden platform was previously placed, was significantly greater with ARA treatment as compared with control (6.0 \u00b1 1.0 and 2.0 \u00b1 1.2 times, P < 0.05) (Figure 8E). Moreover, ARA-treated mice spent nearly twice as long in the southwest (SW) quadrant, where the platform was originally placed during the hidden platform test (NE 16.3.9% \u00b1 1.3%, SE 19.2% \u00b1 1.6%, SW 44.0% \u00b1 3.1%, NW 20.4% \u00b1 2.0%). The sham-treated mice, however, spent approximately equal amounts of time in each quadrant (NE 24.9% \u00b1 1.9%, SE 20.4% \u00b1 2.0%, SW 28.2% \u00b1 1.7%, NW 26.6% \u00b1 2.1%) (Supplemental Figure 3B). These data demonstrate that inhibition of GSK3 signaling significantly improved the memory deficits seen in the AD model mice.

Animal movement was tracked and recorded by ANY-maze tracking software. APP23/PS45 mice at 6 weeks were injected daily for 1 month with ARA or a vehicle solution and subjected to the Morris water maze test (n = 26 mice total, 14 ARA-treated and 12 sham-treated).

GSK3 is involved in tau hyperphosphorylation (65), neuronal apoptosis (66), and synaptic dysfunction (67). Moreover, GSK3 signaling has also been implicated in A\u03b2 production and neuritic plaque formation (51, 54, 68). However, the mechanism by which GSK3 affects APP processing and A\u03b2 production has not been clearly elucidated, and its pharmaceutical potential as an effective drug target remains to be validated. The current study clearly indicates that GSK3\u03b2, but not the related GSK3\u03b1 isoform, facilitates A\u03b2 production by upregulating BACE1 gene expression via NF-\u03baB p65 cis-acting elements on the BACE1 gene promoter. The C-terminal end of BACE1 undergoes phosphorylation, which regulates BACE1 trafficking and cellular levels (69, 70). In our study, inhibition of GSK3 signaling did not affect the phosphorylation status of BACE1 (data not shown). Thus, specifically inhibiting GSK3 decreases BACE1 expression and markedly reduces \u03b2-secretase processing of APP and A\u03b2 production, resulting in inhibition of neuritic plaque formation and amelioration of memory deficits in AD model mice. GSK3 appears to be a common molecular link between amyloidogenesis and tau abnormalities in AD pathology. Therefore, GSK3 inhibition has been proposed to be a valid therapeutic target for treating AD. Lithium chloride and valproic acid are known to have some inhibitory effects on GSK3 (71, 72) and have been used in the clinic for many decades for the treatment of bipolar disorders and epilepsy. Recent work has demonstrated that lithium and valproic acid could reduce A\u03b2 levels and improve cognitive performance in mouse models of AD (54, 68). While the inhibitory effects of lithium and valproic acid on GSK3 are known, both compounds have also been found to affect signaling cascades independent of GSK3. To further investigate the role of GSK3 on APP processing, we administered ARA, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of GSK3 (IC50 = 104 \u00b1 27 nM) (73) to APP Swedish stable cell lines and APP23/PS45 mice. We found that with specific GSK3 inhibition, the BACE1 major product C99 is reduced, accompanied by a significant reduction in A\u03b2 levels. Previous reports indicated that ARA treatment reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and tangle formation in transgenic mice overexpressing human tau, a model of AD (62). Our study shows that ARA also reduces plaque pathology and rescues cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model. However, continuous ARA treatment is required in order to reduce plaque pathology, as APP23/PS45 mice sacrificed 3 months after the last injection had plaque levels similar to those in the control group. Previous work by Phiel et al. (51) demonstrated that inhibition of GSK3\u03b1 with isoform-specific siRNA decreases \u03b3-secretase activity but found no effect of GSK3\u03b2. In our study, we found that in a system in which \u03b3-secretase activity is pharmacologically inhibited, GSK3\u03b1 knockdown did not have any significant effect on APP processing. On the other hand, GSK3\u03b2 knockdown with inhibition of \u03b3-secretase activity reduced the level of C99 fragment, indicating that BACE1 activity is affected. We further provided evidence that knocking down GSK3\u03b2 reduced BACE1 mRNA levels, but knocking down GSK3\u03b1 did not affect BACE1 expression. Previous genetic studies have found that during development GSK3\u03b1 could not compensate for the loss of GSK3\u03b2, as Gsk3b-KO mice are embryonic lethal while Gsk3a-KO mice are viable (61). This argues that GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 isoforms may have distinct cellular functions with respect to BACE1 expression. Moreover, GSK3\u03b2 is the predominant isoform in the brain and therefore has been implicated in many CNS disorders (74). However, Jaworski et al. recently showed the GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 knockout mice did not show any changes to APP processing and A\u03b2 production (52). This could be due to a physiological compensation of BACE1 expression in the KO mice compared with the acute effect of the GSK3 inhibitor. Additionally, our data showed that GSK3\u03b2 regulated NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated BACE1 expression. Gsk3a knockout had no effect on NF-\u03baB signaling. Taken together, these studies suggest that GSK3 isoforms have distinct roles in regulating APP processing. We do not believe that gene silencing of GSK3 isoforms would be a valid approach for treating AD. Complete ablation of each isoform may lead to compensatory elevated activity of the other isoform or even other functionally protein kinases. Moreover, it has been reported that complete ablation of GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 expression in mice results in various abnormalities (75), which may interfere with any therapeutic values. Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested a significant inflammatory component in AD (76\u201379). However, it remains controversial whether neuroinflammation is a driving force for AD or simply a byproduct of the disease (80). Moreover, the detrimental role of astrocyte and microglia during neuroinflammation remains elusive. The release of various proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines has been shown to affect APP processing, A\u03b2 production, and neurodegenerative changes in AD brains. There have been preclinical studies to show that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or anti-inflammatory cytokines have beneficial effects in treating AD (80, 81). However, there are reports demonstrating that anti-inflammatory stimuli could potentiate A\u03b2 production, possibly through suppression of glia-mediated A\u03b2 clearance. On the other hand, proinflammatory stimuli could also have extreme effects on AD pathogenesis. There is a large amount of evidence to show that increased proinflammatory cytokines correlates with A\u03b2 production and neurodegeneration. In contrast, there are also a number of studies indicating that proinflammatory cytokines precondition the system for A\u03b2 challenge and protect against neurodegeneration (82\u201385). Clearly, inflammation is a major component of the AD brain, and more work will be required in order to elucidate its role in AD pathogenesis. Since several proinflammatory cytokines including the interleukins and TNF have been found to activate GSK3\u03b2, and GSK3 inhibitors showed anti-inflammatory effects (86\u201388), we speculate that GSK3 plays an important role in the inflammatory response driving A\u03b2 production. The chronic inflammatory response induced by A\u03b2 may depend on transcription factors to exert neurodegenerative effects. Regulation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and its transcriptional activity may in part play a role in A\u03b2-mediated neurodegeneration (27, 89). It has been previously reported that the BACE1 promoter contains NF-\u03baB\u2013binding elements (27, 90) and exacerbated A\u03b2 levels modulate the BACE1 promoter activity via NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent pathways (91). More recently, Chen et al. (27) found increased NF-\u03baB p65 and BACE1 expression in postmortem AD brains. Furthermore, overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 was found to increase human BACE1 promoter activity, whereas inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling reduced BACE1 expression (27). Exogenous application of A\u03b2 has been found to increase GSK3\u03b2 activity and NF-\u03baB levels. There are many reports suggesting that GSK3\u03b2 regulates gene transcription in an NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent manner (61, 92, 93). Therefore, we argue that the GSK3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is involved in regulating BACE1 gene transcription. In this study, we found that interfering with GSK3\u03b2 activity using Gsk3b-KO cells or ARA treatment reduced BACE1 promoter activity and gene expression. Moreover, disrupting NF-\u03baB expression also blocked GSK3\u03b2-induced BACE1 transcription. Long-term treatment with GSK3 inhibitors always raises the concern about unwanted side effects. Many of the Wnt signal transduction components such as the APC gene or \u03b2-catenin gene carry mutations that render the protein nondegradable (94). Prolonged activation of the Wnt pathway has been linked to development of various cancers (95). GSK3 inhibitors including SB216763, SB415286, Kenpaullone, and lithium chloride have all been shown to elevate the level of \u03b2-catenin (51, 96, 97). Consequently, it may be possible that GSK3 inhibitors may mimic Wnt signaling and could potentially be oncogenic. However, long-term use of lithium chloride to treat bipolar disorder has not been linked to increased risk of cancer. Interestingly, administration of the GSK3 inhibitors CHIR99021 and ARA did not change \u03b2-catenin levels (65). Moreover, \u03b2-catenin levels are largely unaffected in Gsk3b-KO embryos (61). These findings indicate that the inhibition of GSK3 by itself might not be sufficient to elevate the level of \u03b2-catenin. It is possible that there are specific pools of GSK3 that are insensitive to certain GSK3 inhibitors, thereby sparing the effect of increasing \u03b2-catenin levels. In order to validate the therapeutic efficacy of GSK3 inhibition, while minimizing oncogenic side effects, long-term treatment studies in cells and animals will be required. In conclusion, we have found that the GSK3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway regulates BACE1 transcription and thereby facilitates A\u03b2 production in AD. Since GSK3\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB are involved in AD pathogenesis, our results suggest that direct interference of this pathway may be a promising drug target for AD therapy. MethodsCell culture, transfection, and ARA treatment. All cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in an incubator containing 5% CO2. HEK293 (human embryonic kidney), N2a (mouse neuroblastoma), SHSY5Y (human neuroblastoma), and wild-type MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) were maintained in complete DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Gsk3b-KO fibroblast cells were derived from E12.5 Gsk3b-KO mouse embryos and were maintained in complete DMEM (61).

The RelA-KO fibroblast cell line, derived from E12.5\u2013E14.5 mouse embryo fibroblasts, was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and ESGRO (LIF) (100). S9A-GSK3\u03b2 stably transfected SHSY5Y cells, under the control of the tetracycline-regulated mammalian expression T-Rex system (Invitrogen), were maintained in complete DMEM (60). S9A-GSK3\u03b2 gene induction was achieved by stimulation with 1 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline (60). Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using either calcium phosphate or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). L685,458, G2, and ARA (EMD Biosciences) were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with complete cell culture medium. The final DMSO concentrations in each experiment were less than 0.5%. Luciferase assay. BACE1 promoter constructs were transfected into N2a cells and wild-type and Gsk3b-KO MEFs. The Renilla (sea pansy) luciferase vector pCMV-Rluc was co-transfected to normalize transfection efficiency. A luciferase assay was performed 48 hours after transfection with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) as previously described (27). Semiquantitative RT-PCR. RNA was isolated from cells using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). A Thermoscript Reverse Transcription kit (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA from an equal amount of RNA following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The newly synthesized cDNA templates were further amplified via Platinum Taq DNA polymerase in a 20-\u03bcl reaction. The following primers were used to specifically amplify BACE1, GSK3A, GSK3B, APP, and PS1 genes: BACE1 forward 5\u2032-cccgcagacgctcaacatcc and reverse 5\u2032-GCCACTGTCCACAATGCTCTT; GSK3A forward 5\u2032-TGAAGCTGGGCCGTGACAGCGG and reverse 5\u2032-ACATGTACACCTTGACATAG; GSK3B forward 5\u2032-TCAGGAGTGCGGGTCTTCCGAC and reverse 5\u2032-CTCCAGTATTAGCATCTGACGCT; APP forward 5\u2032-GCTGGCCTGCTGGCTGAACC and reverse 5\u2032-GGCGACGGTGTGCCAGTGAA; PS1 forward 5\u2032-GAGACACAGGACAGTGGTTCTGG and reverse 5\u2032-GGCCGATCAGTATGGCTACAAA. \u03b2-Actin was used as an internal control. The samples were resolved and analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel. Immunoblot analysis. Brain tissues or cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 4% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) supplemented with 200 mM sodium orthovanadate, 25 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM PMSF, and a complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche Diagnostics). The samples were diluted in 4\u00d7 SDS-sample buffer, boiled, and resolved on 12% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE or 16% Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvindylidine fluoride (PVDF-FL) membranes. For immunoblot analysis, membranes were blocked for 1 hour in PBS containing 5% nonfat dried milk, followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C in primary antibodies diluted in the blocking medium. Rabbit anti-APP C-terminal polyclonal antibody C20 was used to detect APP and its CTF products. PS1 was detected by anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody 231. Total GSK3\u03b2 was determined using a pan-specific mouse anti-GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 antibody (BioSource International Inc.). Total \u03b2-catenin was determined using a pan-specific rabbit anti\u2013\u03b2-catenin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). The NF-\u03baB p65 subunit was determined using mouse anti-p65 (Sigma-Aldrich). Internal control \u03b2-actin was analyzed using monoclonal antibody AC-15 (Sigma-Aldrich). BACE1 was detected with the anti-BACE1 antibody 208 recognizing the C-terminal end (101). A\u03b240/42 ELISA. HEK293 cells stably expressing the human APP gene containing the Swedish mutation were maintained in cell culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS. Following ARA treatment for 24 hours, conditioned medium was harvested, and protease inhibitors and AEBSF (Roche Diagnostics) were added to prevent degradation of A\u03b2 peptides. APP23/PS45 double transgenic mouse cortical tissues were prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions prior to carrying out the ELISA protocol (Invitrogen). The concentration of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 were detected using an A\u03b21\u201340 or A\u03b21\u201342 Colorimetric ELISA kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. EMSA. Whole brain extracts were prepared by homogenizing the tissue in Buffer C (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitor. EMSA was performed as previously described with a few changes (102). Briefly, 20\u201340 \u03bcg protein was incubated with an IRDye 700\u2013labeled NF-\u03baB oligo (5\u2032-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC), and the gels were scanned using the Odyssey system (LI-COR Biosciences). In the competition assay, unlabeled wild-type and mutant (5\u2032-AGTTGAGGCCACTTTCCCAGGC) NF-\u03baB oligos at \u00d710 and \u00d7100 molar excess were used to compete for binding. Transgenic mice and drug treatment. APP23 mice overexpressing the Swedish APP751 (KM\u2192NL) mutant transgene driven by the mouse Thy1.2 promoter were originally generated at Novartis Pharma as previously described (30, 103). APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice were generated by crossing APP23 mice with mice overexpressing the human G384A-mutated PS1 under the control of the murine Thy1 promoter (B6,D2-TgN(Thy1-PS1G384A)45) (54, 103\u2013105). APP23 and PS45 mice had been backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice for more than 7 generations prior to breeding for the double transgenic mice. The genotype of the mice was confirmed by PCR using DNA from tail tissues. The treatment group contained 14 animals (8 females, 6 males), and the sham-injected group contained 12 animals (7 females, 5 males). The treatment group received 5 mg/kg ARA diluted in 0.9% saline daily via intraperitoneal injection at the same time each day. Mice in the control group were injected with the vehicle solution containing DMSO diluted in 0.9% saline only. We tabulated the daily food consumption and weight for each mouse. Immunohistochemical staining. Mice were sacrificed after behavioral testing, and half brains were immediately homogenized for protein, RNA, or DNA extraction. The other halves of the brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned with a Leica Cryostat to 30-\u03bcm thickness. Every twelfth slice with the same reference position was mounted onto slides for staining. Immunocytochemical staining was performed on floating sections. The plaques in the sections were detected with biotinylated monoclonal 4G8 antibody (Signetlabs) in 1:500 dilution, visualized by the ABC and DAB method, and counted under a \u00d740 objective as previously described (54, 63). Plaques were quantified, and the average plaque count per slice was recorded for each mouse. Thioflavin-S staining of plaques was performed with 1% thioflavin-S visualized using fluorescence microscopy (54). Morris water maze test. The Morris water maze test was performed as previously described (30, 64). The APP23/PS45 mice treated with or without ARA were subjected to the Morris water maze test 1 day after the last injection regimen. The test was performed in a 1.5-meter-diameter pool with a 10-cm-diameter platform placed in the SE quadrant of the pool. The procedure consisted of 1 day of visible platform tests and 4 days of hidden platform tests, plus a probe trial 24 hours after the last hidden platform test. In the visible platform test performed on the first day, the mice were tested for 5 continuous trials, with an inter-trial interval of 60 minutes. In the hidden platform tests, mice were trained for 5 trials, with an inter-trial interval of 1 hour. Each mouse was allowed 60 seconds to search for the platform. In the scenario where the mouse could not locate the platform, the experiment guided it to the platform and allowed the mouse to rest there for 15 seconds. On the last day of the test, each mouse was subjected to the probe trial in which the platform was removed. Each mouse was given 60 seconds to locate where the platform was originally placed. Mouse behavior including distance traveled, escape latency and the number of passes through the platform was recorded by automated video tracking (ANY-maze, Stoelting). The data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. Statistics. All results were presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and analyzed by ANOVA or 2-tailed Student\u2019s t-test. Statistical significance is accepted when P < 0.05. Study approval. Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the University of British Columbia Animal Care and Use Committee and Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) guidelines.Supplemental dataView Supplemental dataAcknowledgmentsWe thank Steven R.

First published December 3, 2012Received for publication April 26, 2012, and accepted in revised form September 27, 2012.Deposition of amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) to form neuritic plaques in the brain is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). A\u03b2 is generated from sequential cleavages of the \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases, and \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the \u03b2-secretase essential for A\u03b2 generation. Previous studies have indicated that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) may play a role in APP processing by modulating \u03b3-secretase activity, thereby facilitating A\u03b2 production. There are two highly conserved isoforms of GSK3: GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2. We now report that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production by decreasing BACE1 gene transcription and expression. The regulation of BACE1 gene expression by GSK3\u03b2 was dependent on NF-\u03baB signaling. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling markedly reduced A\u03b2 deposition and neuritic plaque formation, and rescued memory deficits in the double transgenic AD model mice. These data provide evidence for regulation of BACE1 expression and AD pathogenesis by GSK3\u03b2 and that inhibition of GSK3 signaling can reduce A\u03b2 neuropathology and alleviate memory deficits in AD model mice. Our study suggests that interventions that specifically target the \u03b2-isoform of GSK3 may be a safe and effective approach for treating AD. IntroductionAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia. The characteristic neuropathological features of AD include neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2), the central component of neuritic plaques, is produced from sequential endoproteolytic cleavages of the type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase. Proteolytic processing of APP at the \u03b2 site is essential for generating A\u03b2, and \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the \u03b2-secretase in vivo (1\u20134). BACE1 cleaves APP at two \u03b2-sites, Asp+1 and Glu+11 of the A\u03b2 domain, to generate C99 and C89 fragment, respectively (5). Subsequently, \u03b3-secretase cleaves C99 within its transmembrane domain to release A\u03b2 and APP C-terminal fragment \u03b3 (CTF\u03b3). In addition to APP, BACE1 substrates also include other proteins: LRP (6), APLP1 (7), APLP2 (8), ST6Gal I (9), and PSGL-1 (10). BACE1 expression is tightly regulated at the level of transcription (5, 11, 12) and translation (13\u201316). It was reported that a G/C polymorphism in exon 5 of the BACE1 gene might be associated with some sporadic cases of AD (17\u201319). Although genetic analyses from our and other laboratories have failed to uncover any mutation in the BACE1 coding sequence or any disease-associated SNP in its promoter region in AD patients (20\u201322), increased \u03b2-secretase levels and activity have been reported in AD (23\u201327). BACE1 levels were elevated in neurons around plaques (28). BACE1 mRNA levels tended to increase as miR-107 levels decreased in the progression of AD (29). We reported that hypoxia, a common vascular component among AD risk factors, increased BACE1 expression, resulting in both increased A\u03b2 deposition and memory deficits in AD transgenic mice (30). Recently we found that both NF-\u03baB and BACE1 levels were increased in sporadic AD patients, and NF-\u03baB facilitated BACE1 gene expression and APP processing (27). Thus, increased BACE1 expression by NF-\u03baB signaling in the brain could be one of the mechanisms underlying AD development (27). Together, these studies indicate that BACE1 dysregulation plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. BACE1 has been considered as one of the major targets for AD drug development. Bace1-knockout mice have abolished A\u03b2 generation (31\u201333). Suppression of BACE1 by RNA interference reduced APP processing and A\u03b2 production in primary cortical neurons derived from both wild-type and Swedish APP mutant transgenic mice (34), and disruption of the Bace1 gene rescued memory deficits and cholinergic dysfunction in Swedish APP mice (35). Oral administration of a potent and selective BACE1 inhibitor decreased \u03b2-cleavage and A\u03b2 production in APP transgenic mice in vivo (36). Bace1-KO mice were reported to display hypomyelination of peripheral nerves and aberrant axonal segregation (37, 38), suggesting that inhibiting \u03b2-secretase may have unwanted collateral effects. However, even a partial reduction in BACE1 can have dramatically beneficial effects on AD pathology (39), suggesting that therapeutic inhibition of BACE1 is a valid therapeutic target for AD treatment. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinase originally identified as playing an important role in glycogen metabolism. Since its discovery, many studies have shown that GSK3 has pleiotropic functions, including embryonic development, gene transcription, and neuronal cell function (40). In mammals, two GSK3 isoforms are encoded by distinct genes: GSK3A produces a 51-kDa GSK3\u03b1 protein and GSK3B a 47-kDa GSK3\u03b2 protein (41). These two isoforms are highly homologous, sharing greater than 95% amino acid identity in the catalytic domains. Although both isoforms are ubiquitously expressed, the \u03b2 isoform is expressed at higher levels in neuronal tissues (42). GSK3 activity is regulated at several levels. Phosphorylation of Tyr279/Tyr216 on GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 is important for enzymatic activity (43). Inactivation of GSK3 can be achieved through phosphorylation of Ser21/Ser9 residues within the N-terminal domain on GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2, respectively. Stimulation of tissues by insulin and growth factors activates the PI3K/PKB/Akt signal transduction cascade, leading to phosphorylation of these inhibitory serine residues (44, 45). GSK3 is also regulated upon interaction of the Wnt ligand and its receptor Frizzled and co-receptor LRP5/6. This interaction releases GSK3 from a multi-protein complex formed by \u03b2-catenin, axin, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (46, 47), which prevents GSK3-mediated \u03b2-catenin degradation and induces \u03b2-catenin\u2013dependent gene transcription. Dysregulation of GSK3 activity has been implicated in AD. Increased GSK3\u03b2 activity was found in postmortem AD brains (48). GSK3\u03b2 has been found to phosphorylate the tau protein on various conserved sites and contribute to tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation (49, 50). GSK3\u03b1 was reported to regulate A\u03b2 production by positively modulating the \u03b3-secretase complex (51), although this finding has recently been challenged (52). Inhibition of GSK3 activity with the commonly known GSK3 inhibitors LiCl and valproic acid in cell culture (53) and animal models of AD decreased A\u03b2 production (51, 54). Although LiCl and valproic acid are known to inhibit GSK3 activity, these compounds also activate a plethora of signaling cascades that could differentially regulate APP processing independent of GSK3 (55\u201358). In this study, we examined the effects of GSK3\u03b2-specific inhibition on AD neuropathology and behavioral deficits and identified its underlying mechanism. We found that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP. Treatment with the GSK3 inhibitor AR-A014418 (ARA) reduced neuritic plaque formation and alleviated memory deficits in AD transgenic model mice. Furthermore, we found that GSK3\u03b2 regulated BACE1 transcription via NF-\u03baB signaling. Our work provides evidence that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 may be an effective therapeutic approach for treating AD. ResultsRegulation of \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production by GSK3 signaling. Previous studies showed that LiCl and valproic acid modulated GSK3 signaling and reduced A\u03b2 production (51, 54). However, the underlying mechanism is not well defined, and these compounds also have many confounding GSK3-independent effects. To examine the specific effect of GSK3 signaling on APP processing, we applied ARA, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of GSK3, to 20E2 cells, a stable cell line expressing human Swedish mutant APP (5). ARA at 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM significantly decreased the levels of the \u03b2-secretase cleavage product APP C99 to 95.7% \u00b1 1.6%, 66.4% \u00b1 0.7%, and 31.3% \u00b1 0.4%, respectively (P < 0.001 by 1-way ANOVA) (Figure 1A and B). The treatment had no significant effect on APP expression (Figure 1A). The A\u03b2 ELISA was performed to assess the levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 in the conditioned media of 20E2 cells. ARA markedly reduced A\u03b2 generation in a dose-dependent manner. A\u03b240 was decreased to 99.2% \u00b1 3.8%, 73.2% \u00b1 4.6%, and 48.7% \u00b1 1.3% with 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM of ARA treatment, respectively (P < 0.05) (Figure 1C); and A\u03b242 was reduced to 99.2% \u00b1 3.1%, 73.2% \u00b1 3.5%, and 48.7% \u00b1 4.5% with 1, 2.5 and 5 \u03bcM of ARA treatment, respectively (P < 0.01 by 1-way ANOVA) (Figure 1D). As expected, inhibition of GSK3 stabilized \u03b2-catenin (Figure 1A), and ARA treatment resulted in a significant increase in \u03b2-catenin levels to 152.7% \u00b1 11.1%, 221.3% \u00b1 17.0%, and 233.7% \u00b1 25.0% with 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM, respectively (P < 0.05). These data indicate that specifically inhibiting GSK3 reduced BACE1-mediated APP processing and C99 and A\u03b2 production. Specific inhibition of GSK3 reduces BACE1 cleavage of APP.Figure 1Specific inhibition of GSK3 reduces BACE1 cleavage of APP. (A) Swedish mutant APP stable cell line 20E2 was cultured and treated with ARA for 24 hours, and cell lysates subjected to Western blot analysis. Full-length APP and the APP CTFs were detected with C20 antibody. \u03b2-Catenin was detected by anti\u2013\u03b2-catenin antibody. \u03b2-Actin was detected by anti-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control. (B) Quantification of APP C99 generation in 20E2 cells. ARA treatment significantly increased \u03b2-catenin levels in a dose-dependent manner, while APP C99 production decreased with increasing ARA dosage. n = 6; *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, ANOVA. A\u03b2 ELISA detection of A\u03b240 (C) and A\u03b242 (D) in conditioned medium from 20E2 cells treated with ARA for 24 hours. ARA treatment reduced A\u03b2 levels in the conditioned medium in a dose-dependent manner. The values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, ANOVA. (E) \u03b3-Secretase activity in 20E2 cells was inhibited by the pharmacological inhibitor L685,458 (GSI). Co-treatment with specific GSK3 inhibitors ARA and G2 reduced C99. Con, control. (F) Quantification of C99 levels. n = 6; *P < 0.05, ANOVA. To further examine the effect of GSK3 on \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production, we pharmacologically blocked \u03b3-secretase activity with the \u03b3-secretase\u2013specific inhibitor L658,458 in 20E2 cells while co-treating with the GSK3 inhibitor ARA and G2. G2 is another structurally distinct GSK3 inhibitor, with an IC50 of 304 nM (59). As expected, \u03b3-secretase inhibition resulted in markedly increased generation of the APP CTFs C83 and C99 (Figure 1E). Addition of ARA or G2 reduced C99 levels to 78.2% \u00b1 1.1% and 63.9% \u00b1 6.6% (Figure 1, E and F). ARA treatment had no significant effect on Notch cleavage (Supplemental Figure 1B; supplemental material available online with this article; doi: 10.1172/JCI64516DS1). These data demonstrated that specific inhibition of GSK3 reduced \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP to generate C99 and A\u03b2 production in cells. GSK3\u03b2 but not GSK3\u03b1 regulates BACE1 gene expression and BACE1-mediated APP processing. Our study has shown that GSK3 regulated \u03b2-secretase processing of APP, an essential step for A\u03b2 generation. Since BACE1 is the \u03b2-secretase in vivo, we first examined whether GSK3 affects BACE1 gene expression. GSK3 has two highly homologous isoforms, GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2. We used RNA interference to specifically knock down the expression of GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 isoforms in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to determine whether both isoforms or one of the isoforms play a major role in regulating BACE1 gene expression. Specific knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 expression by the siRNA significantly reduced BACE1 mRNA levels to 76.0% \u00b1 6.6% as compared with control (P < 0.05) (Figure 2, A and B), whereas knockdown of GSK3\u03b1 did not affect BACE1 mRNA expression (P > 0.05) (Figure 2, A and B). Additional exogenous expression of GSK3\u03b2 rescued the reduction of BACE1 expression resulting from knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 by siRNA (Supplemental Figure 2). To examine whether specific knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 expression also affected \u03b2-secretase processing of APP, we transfected siRNA specific to GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 into 20E2 cells while inhibiting \u03b3-secretase activity with L658,458. Western blotting showed that GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 siRNA specifically reduced GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 expression, respectively (Figure 2C). Knockdown of GSK3\u03b1 expression did not significantly affect BACE1-mediated APP processing, whereas GSK3\u03b2 knockdown reduced the production of the BACE1 cleavage product C99 to 51.9% \u00b1 6.4% (P < 0.05) (Figure 2, C and D). GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, regulates BACE1 gene expression and APP processing.Figure 2GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, regulates BACE1 gene expression and APP processing. (A) SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were transfected with scrambled GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 isoform\u2013specific siRNA. RNA was extracted, and semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed to measure endogenous human BACE1, GSK3A, GSK3B, and \u03b2-actin mRNA levels with specific primers recognizing the coding sequence of each gene. PCR products after 28 cycles were analyzed on 1.2% agarose gel. (B) Endogenous BACE1 mRNA was significantly reduced with GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, isoform\u2013specific knockdown. The values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 3; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. (C) 20E2 cells were transfected with scrambled or GSK3\u03b1, or GSK3\u03b2 isoform\u2013specific siRNA while cotreated with L685,458 to block \u03b3-secretase activity. Full-length APP and CTF fragments were detected with C20 antibody. GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 were detected using a monoclonal GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 antibody. GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 isoforms were selectively reduced by the isoform-specific siRNA. \u03b2-Actin served as an internal control and was detected using a monoclonal anti\u2013\u03b2-actin antibody, AC-15. (D) GSK3\u03b2-specific knockdown significantly reduced C99 levels. GSK3\u03b1-specific knockdown did not have any significant effect. The values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. (E) Tetracycline-regulated SHSY5Y cells were induced to express constitutively active S9A-GSK3\u03b2. Endogenous human BACE1 mRNA levels were assessed as described above. Tetracyline-induced S9A-GSK3\u03b2 significantly increased BACE1 expression. (F) Quantification of the endogenous BACE1 mRNA level. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. To further confirm that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene expression at the transcription level, we assayed BACE1 mRNA in the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 inducible SHSY5Y stable cell line. This stable cell line carries the constitutively active mutant GSK3\u03b2, and expression of the mutant gene is under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (60). Addition of tetracycline induced the expression of active GSK3\u03b2 (Figure 2E) and resulted in significantly increased expression of BACE1 to 251.1% \u00b1 70.0% relative to the control (P < 0.05) (Figure 2F). These data demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, specifically regulates BACE1 gene expression and contribute to APP processing. GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene promoter activity. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 gene expression at the transcription level, we performed a BACE1 gene promoter assay. Two human BACE1 gene promoter deletion plasmids were constructed. Regions of the BACE1 promoter from \u20132890 to +292 bp (pB1-A) and from \u20139 to +292 bp (pB1-B) were inserted into promoterless vector pGL3-basic upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Figure 3A). To examine the effect of GSK3 on BACE1 gene promoter activity, we transfected N2a cells with pB1-A and then treated them with ARA. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling by ARA significantly decreased the promoter activity of pB1-A in N2a cells to 54.9% \u00b1 6.2% (P < 0.005) (Figure 3B). To further investigate the underlying mechanism and determine the BACE1 promoter region that mediates the transcriptional activation by GSK3 signaling, we co-transfected N2a cells with either pB1-A or pB1-B plasmid together with the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 plasmid, which carries a constitutively active form of GSK3\u03b2. Expression of active GSK3\u03b2 markedly increased the luciferase activity of pB1-A in the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 transfected cells to 144.0% \u00b1 2.0% as compared with the control (P < 0.05), but had no significant effect on the luciferase activity of pB1-B (P > 0.05) (Figure 3C). This result showed that enhancing GSK3\u03b2 signaling upregulated BACE1 gene promoter activity and the 2.8-kb promoter region is responsible for GSK3\u03b2-mediated upregulation of BACE1 transcription. To further confirm this finding, we transfected these two deletion promoter plasmids into Gsk3b-KO or wild-type cells. Ablation of Gsk3b expression in the Gsk3b-KO cells resulted in significant reduction in luciferase activity of pB1-A to 47.0% \u00b1 7.5% as compared with the wild-type control cells (P < 0.01) (Figure 3D). However, knockout of the Gsk3b gene had no significant effect on the luciferase activity of pB1-B (Figure 3D). Taken together, these results demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene expression via its effect on the BACE1 promoter. GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 promoter activation.Figure 3GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 promoter activation. (A) Schematic of the 3.3-kb (pB1-A) and 300-bp (pB1-B) human BACE1 promoter/luciferase construct. (B) The 3.5-kb human BACE1 promoter was transfected into N2a cells and treated with 5 \u03bcM ARA. GSK3 inhibition with ARA treatment resulted in a significant decrease in luciferase activity. (C) N2a cells were co-transfected with either promoter constructs and S9A-GSK3\u03b2 or a vector control. S9A-GSK3\u03b2 significantly increased the luciferase activity of the 3.3-kb BACE1 promoter construct but did not have any effect on the 300-bp promoter construct. (D) pB1-A or pB1-B constructs were transfected into Gsk3b-KO MEFs. pB1-A had significantly reduced promoter activity. All promoter data shown represent an average of at least 4 independent experiments, with each condition performed in triplicate. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005, Student\u2019s t test. NF-\u03baB mediates the transcriptional regulation of BACE1 gene expression by GSK3\u03b2. Recently we reported that levels of both BACE1 and NF-\u03baB are increased in AD brains, and NF-\u03baB signaling upregulates human BACE1 gene expression by acting on the cis-acting p65-binding element in its promoter (27). Previous studies in Gsk3b-KO mice demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2 is required for proper activation of NF-\u03baB (61). As our data indicate that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene transcription, we next examined whether regulation of BACE1 transcription by GSK3\u03b2 signaling is dependent on NF-\u03baB. TNF-\u03b1 is a strong activator of NF-\u03baB p65 expression. In order to examine the specific role of NF-\u03baB in GSK3\u03b2-regulated BACE1 transcription, we transfected N2a cells with a pBACE1-4\u03baB promoter plasmid that contained only the NF-\u03baB\u2013binding elements in the human BACE1 promoter (27). After transfection, the cells were cotreated with TNF-\u03b1 and the GSK3 inhibitor ARA. ARA treatment alone consistently reduced BACE1 promoter activity (Figure 4A). TNF-\u03b1 stimulation increased pB1A promoter activity to 132.6% \u00b1 7.5% of the control (P < 0.01). However, ARA treatment reduced the TNF-\u03b1\u2013induced BACE1 promoter activation to 115.6 \u00b1 6.9% as compared with TNF-\u03b1 treatment alone (P < 0.05) (Figure 4A). Overexpression of p65 NF-\u03baB significantly increased the BACE1 promoter activity to 487.1% \u00b1 102.2% as compared with the control (P < 0.001) (Figure 3D). However, ARA did not affect NF-\u03baB p65\u2019s upregulating effect on BACE1 promoter activity (P > 0.05), indicating that GSK3 signaling may have its effect upstream of NF-\u03baB in the modulation of BACE1 transcription (Figure 4B). To further confirm ARA\u2019s effect on NF-\u03baB activity, we co-transfected N2a cells with pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc and NF-\u03baB p65 or an empty vector, followed by treatment with ARA to inhibit GSK3 signaling. ARA reduced pNF-\u03baB-Luc promoter activity to 51.9% \u00b1 9.1% as compared with control (P < 0.05) (Figure 4C). Overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 significantly increased pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc promoter activity to 203.36 \u00b1 87.38\u2013fold (P < 0.001) (Figure 4C). Additional ARA treatment did not have any significant effect on the transcriptional activation of pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc by NF-\u03baB p65 overexpression (P > 0.05) (Figure 4C). These data indicate that the p65-binding elements in the BACE1 promoter mediated the effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 transcription. GSK3\u03b2 regulation of BACE1 transcription is dependent on NF-\u03baB p65 expressioFigure 4GSK3\u03b2 regulation of BACE1 transcription is dependent on NF-\u03baB p65 expression. (A) pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB plasmid contains the 4 NF-\u03baB cis-elements from the human BACE1 promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. N2a cells were co-transfected with pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB and pCMV-RLuc. Transfected cells were treated with vehicle solution (control) or 10 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 with/without 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours. (B) N2a cells were co-transfected with pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB plasmid and pMTF-p65 or a vector control. Transfected cells were then treated with a vehicle solution or 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours. (C) pNF-\u03baB-Luc was co-transfected with pMTF-p65 or a vector control and treated with a vehicle solution or 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours. Renilla luciferase was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, Student\u2019s t test. (D) Wild-type MEFs and RelA-KO MEFs which are dysfunctional for NF-\u03baB activity, were co-transfected with a 3.5-kb human BACE1 promoter and S9A-GSK3\u03b2 or a control vector. S9A-GSK3\u03b2 overexpression in MEFs. significantly increased luciferase activity (*P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test), whereas RelA-KO MEFs did not have any significant effect. Luciferase activity is indicative of BACE1 promoter activity. All promoter data shown represent an average of at least 4 independent experiments, with each condition performed in triplicate. (E) N2a cells were treated with 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours, followed by cell fractionation. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. ARA treatment significantly reduced NF-\u03baB p65 levels in the (F) nuclear fraction (n = 6; **P < 0.001, Student\u2019s t test) and (G) cytosolic fraction. n = 6; ***P < 0.001, Student\u2019s t test. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. To confirm the role of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in GSK3\u03b2-mediated BACE1 transcription, we transfected NF-\u03baB p65 knockout RelA-KO cells and wild-type control cells with the BACE1 promoter pB1-A and the constitutively active GSK3\u03b2 expression plasmid S9A-GSK3\u03b2. In wild-type cells, activation of GSK3\u03b2 signaling by expression of S9A-GSK3\u03b2 markedly increased BACE1 promoter activity to 189.6% \u00b1 20.9% as compared with the vector control (P < 0.05), whereas activation of GSK3\u03b2 signaling by expression of S9A-GSK3\u03b2 had no effect on BACE1 promoter activity in RelA-KO cells (P > 0.05) (Figure 4D), indicating that disruption of NF-\u03baB p65 expression in RelA-KO cells abolished GSK3\u03b2\u2019s effect on the transcriptional activation of the human BACE1 gene promoter. To further examine the effect of GSK3 inhibition on NF-\u03baB p65 expression, we treated N2a cells with ARA and subjected them to subcellular fractionation (Figure 4E). ARA treatment significantly reduced nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 levels to 46.9% \u00b1 9.1% as compared with control (P < 0.01) (Figure 4F). Moreover, ARA treatment also reduced cytosolic NF-\u03baB p65 levels to 56.1% \u00b1 7.1% as compared with control (P < 0.001) (Figure 4G). These data show that GSK3 inhibition with ARA reduced NF-\u03baB activity by decreasing NF-\u03baB p65 levels. Taken together, our results demonstrate that NF-\u03baB signaling mediates the regulatory effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 gene expression. GSK3 regulates BACE1 gene expression, APP processing, and A\u03b2 production in vivo. Our data provide strong evidence that GSK3\u03b2 activates BACE1 gene expression, resulting in enhanced \u03b2-secretase processing of APP and A\u03b2 production in vitro. To examine the effect of GSK3 signaling on BACE1 gene expression and APP processing in vivo, we first assayed APP CTFs and A\u03b2 production in the brain of APP23/PS45 mice by Western blot analysis (Figure 5, A and B). APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice, an AD mouse model, were generated by crossing APP23 mice, carrying the human Swedish mutant APP751 transgene driven by the neuron-specific Thy1.2 promoter, and PS45 mice, carrying the human familial AD\u2013associated G384A mutant presenilin-1 (PS1) (54). The mice were treated with 5 mg/kg of the GSK3 inhibitor ARA at 6 weeks of age daily for 4 weeks, while age-matched control mice received vehicle solution. ARA treatment significantly decreased the brain levels of the \u03b2-secretase\u2013generated CTF\u03b2 fragments C99 and C89, to 38.4% \u00b1 4.8% relative to controls (P < 0.05) (Figure 5B). The levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 were reduced to 71.2% \u00b1 8.3% and 65.6% \u00b1 11.0% in ARA-treated mice relative to controls, (P < 0.05) (Figure 5, C and D). These data demonstrate that inhibition of GSK3 activity by ARA treatment reduces \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo. ARA inhibits BACE1 cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo.Figure 5ARA inhibits BACE1 cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo. (A) Hemi-brains from ARA-treated and control APP23/PS45 mice of the 6 weeks age group were homogenized in RIPA-Doc lysis buffer and separated with 12% Tris-glycine or 16% Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE. Full-length APP and APP CTFs (C99 and C89) were detected by C20 polyclonal antibody. PS1 was detected by anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody 231. BACE1 was detected by anti-BACE1 antibody. \u03b2-Actin was detected by anti\u2013\u03b2-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control. (B) Quantification showed that CTF\u03b2 was significantly decreased in ARA-treated mice. n = 25 mice total. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, Student\u2019s t test. ELISA was performed to measure A\u03b240 (C) and A\u03b242 (D) levels from the brain tissues of APP23/PS45 mice injected with or without ARA. n = 8 for each group; *P < 0.005, Student\u2019s t test. (E) Total RNA was isolated from APP23/PS45 mouse cortices by TRI Reagent. Sets of gene-specific primers were used to amplify Bace1 (E), PS1 (G), and App (I) genes. \u03b2-Actin was used as an internal control. Bace1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced (F), while there were no difference in endogenous PS1 (H) or App (J) mRNA levels between ARA-treated mice and controls. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 12 total; *P < 0.01, Student\u2019s t test. We then examined whether the level of BACE1 was altered by GSK3 signaling in vivo. Western blot analysis showed that inhibition of GSK3 signaling significantly reduced the protein level of BACE1 to 64.7% \u00b1 7.3% in ARA-treated mice, as compared with the control mice (P < 0.01), and the treatment had no significant effect on APP and PS1 protein levels (P > 0.05) (Figure 5, A and B). We further showed that GSK3 inhibition with ARA reduced tau phosphorylation, which is consistent with previous findings (ref. 62 and Supplemental Figure 1A). Our in vitro study has shown that GSK3\u03b2 regulates the transcription of the BACE1 gene. To confirm that the decrease in BACE1 protein level seen in the brains of the ARA-treated mice was due to reduced BACE1 gene transcription, the endogenous Bace1 mRNA levels were measured (Figure 5, E, G, and I). ARA treatment markedly reduced Bace1 mRNA level to 36.7% \u00b1 11.8% (P < 0.01) (Figure 5F), but did not significantly change the mRNA levels of App and PS1 genes (P > 0.05) (Figure 5, H and J). These data demonstrate that, consistent with the in vitro results, inhibition of GSK3 specifically inhibited Bace1 gene expression and its \u03b2-secretase activity in vivo. Our study has demonstrated that NF-\u03baB signaling is required for GSK3\u03b2\u2019s regulatory effect on BACE1 gene expression in vitro. To confirm this effect in vivo, we examined whether NF-\u03baB activity was affected in APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice administered ARA. EMSA was used to assess NF-\u03baB consensus DNA binding in whole brain lysates. ARA treatment inhibited the binding of NF-\u03baB p65 protein to the cis-acting consensus oligonucleotide probe, resulting in a reduction in the intensity of the p65 NF-\u03baB shifted bands (Figure 6A). The specificity of the bands was confirmed by competition assay with addition of \u00d710 and \u00d7100 unlabeled wild-type NF-\u03baB oligonucleotides (oligos), while the mutant NF-\u03baB oligos did not have any significant effect on the shifted bands (Figure 6B). Consistent with the in vitro experiment, APP23/PS45 mice receiving ARA treatment showed a significant reduction in NF-\u03baB levels to 62.9% \u00b1 6.9% of those in the sham-injected controls (P < 0.005) (Figure 6, C and D). Thus, inhibition of GSK3 signaling attenuates NF-\u03baB binding to cis-acting p65 binding elements by reducing NF-\u03baB levels in the AD transgenic model mice in vivo. ARA reduced NF-\u03baB binding in APP23/PS45 mouse brains.Figure 6ARA reduced NF-\u03baB binding in APP23/PS45 mouse brains. APP23/PS45 mice were injected daily with ARA for 4 weeks, and whole brain lysates were subjected to EMSA. (A) Mice that received ARA had reduced intensity of NF-\u03baB shifted band. n = 3. (B) Whole brain lysates subjected to EMSA was competed with 10- and 100-fold excess of the wild-type and mutant NF-\u03baB oligos to demonstrate the specificity of binding. (C) Daily injections of ARA to APP23/PS45 mice for 6 weeks reduced NF-\u03baB p65 levels in the whole brain lysates. (D) Quantification of the band intensity of NF-\u03baB p65 levels. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 25 total; *P < 0.005. GSK3 inhibition reduces neuritic plaque formation in the AD model mice. To examine the specific effect of GSK3 signaling on AD pathogenesis, we treated APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice with ARA. The double transgenic mice develop detectable neuritic plaques in the neocortex and hippocampus as early as 1 month of age. The mice were treated with 5 mg/kg ARA at 6 weeks of age daily for 4 weeks, while age-matched control mice received vehicle solution. 4G8 immunostaining and thioflavin-S staining were used to detect A\u03b2-containing neuritic plaques in the brains (ref. 63 and Figure 7). ARA treatment significantly decreased the number of neuritic plaques in the transgenic mice relative to the vehicle-injected group (Figure 7, A and B). Quantification showed that overall ARA treatment reduced plaque number by approximately 50% (23.8 \u00b1 4.7 vs. 10.4 \u00b1 1.3 per slice, P < 0.01) (Figure 7C). Thioflavin-S staining also confirmed that ARA treatment dramatically reduced the number of A\u03b2-containing neuritic plaques in the brains of APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice (Figure 7, D and E). The inhibitory effect of ARA was reversible, and the treated mice (Figure 7G) had plaque numbers similar to those in the control mice (Figure 7F) when examined 3 months after the end of the drug treatment (36.5 \u00b1 5.1 vs. 32.1 \u00b1 4.2, P > 0.05) (Figure 7H). During the 4-week injection period, ARA treatment of the mice did not affect food consumption, and no significant weight changes were observed between the treatment and control groups (data not shown).

(A and B) APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice at the age of 6 weeks were treated with ARA (5 mg/kg) for 4 weeks, while age-matched control APP23/PS45 mice received vehicle solution. The mice were sacrificed after behavioral tests, and the brains were dissected, fixed, and sectioned. Neuritic plaques were detected using A\u03b2 specific monoclonal antibody 4G8 (Signet). The plaques were visualized by microscopy with \u00d740 magnification.

Inhibition of GSK3 significantly improves memory deficits in the AD model mice. To investigate whether GSK3 inhibition by ARA treatment affects the memory deficit in AD pathogenesis, we used the Morris water maze to test spatial memory after APP23/PS45 mice received 1 month of ARA treatment (64). In the visible platform tests, ARA-treated and control APP23/PS45 mice had similar escape latency (42.4 \u00b1 4.3 and 44.8 \u00b1 2.7 seconds, P > 0.05) (Figure 8A) and path length (6.6 \u00b1 0.7 m and 6.1 \u00b1 0.5 m, P > 0.05) (Figure 8B), indicating that ARA treatment did not affect mouse mobility or vision. In the hidden platform test, ARA-treated mice showed significant improvements as compared with the vehicle-treated controls. The escape latency on the third and fourth days of the hidden platform test was shorter (12.0 \u00b1 1.6 and 17.4 \u00b1 3.1 seconds) than that of sham-treated mice (23.8 \u00b1 4.0 s and 24.9 \u00b1 2.7 s) (P < 0.05, Figure 8C). The ARA-treated mice swam significantly shorter distances to reach the platform (2.9 \u00b1 0.7 m and 3.2 \u00b1 0.3 m) as compared with control mice (3.7 \u00b1 0.6 and 4.2 \u00b1 0.5 m) on the third and fourth days (P < 0.05, Figure 8D). In the probe trial on the last day of testing, the platform was removed. ARA treatment significantly improved the spatial memory in the APP23/PS45 mice, as these mice spent more time searching for the platform in the appropriate quadrant (Supplemental Figure 3A). The number of times the mice traveled into the third quadrant, where the hidden platform was previously placed, was significantly greater with ARA treatment as compared with control (6.0 \u00b1 1.0 and 2.0 \u00b1 1.2 times, P < 0.05) (Figure 8E). Moreover, ARA-treated mice spent nearly twice as long in the southwest (SW) quadrant, where the platform was originally placed during the hidden platform test (NE 16.3.9% \u00b1 1.3%, SE 19.2% \u00b1 1.6%, SW 44.0% \u00b1 3.1%, NW 20.4% \u00b1 2.0%). The sham-treated mice, however, spent approximately equal amounts of time in each quadrant (NE 24.9% \u00b1 1.9%, SE 20.4% \u00b1 2.0%, SW 28.2% \u00b1 1.7%, NW 26.6% \u00b1 2.1%) (Supplemental Figure 3B). These data demonstrate that inhibition of GSK3 signaling significantly improved the memory deficits seen in the AD model mice. ARA improves memory deficits in AD transgenic mice.Figure 8ARA improves memory deficits in AD transgenic mice. A Morris water maze test consists of 1 day of visible platform trials and 4 days of hidden platform trials, plus a probe trial 24 hours after the last hidden platform trial. Animal movement was tracked and recorded by ANY-maze tracking software. APP23/PS45 mice at 6 weeks were injected daily for 1 month with ARA or a vehicle solution and subjected to the Morris water maze test (n = 26 mice total, 14 ARA-treated and 12 sham-treated).

GSK3 is involved in tau hyperphosphorylation (65), neuronal apoptosis (66), and synaptic dysfunction (67). Moreover, GSK3 signaling has also been implicated in A\u03b2 production and neuritic plaque formation (51, 54, 68). However, the mechanism by which GSK3 affects APP processing and A\u03b2 production has not been clearly elucidated, and its pharmaceutical potential as an effective drug target remains to be validated. The current study clearly indicates that GSK3\u03b2, but not the related GSK3\u03b1 isoform, facilitates A\u03b2 production by upregulating BACE1 gene expression via NF-\u03baB p65 cis-acting elements on the BACE1 gene promoter. The C-terminal end of BACE1 undergoes phosphorylation, which regulates BACE1 trafficking and cellular levels (69, 70). In our study, inhibition of GSK3 signaling did not affect the phosphorylation status of BACE1 (data not shown). Thus, specifically inhibiting GSK3 decreases BACE1 expression and markedly reduces \u03b2-secretase processing of APP and A\u03b2 production, resulting in inhibition of neuritic plaque formation and amelioration of memory deficits in AD model mice. GSK3 appears to be a common molecular link between amyloidogenesis and tau abnormalities in AD pathology. Therefore, GSK3 inhibition has been proposed to be a valid therapeutic target for treating AD. Lithium chloride and valproic acid are known to have some inhibitory effects on GSK3 (71, 72) and have been used in the clinic for many decades for the treatment of bipolar disorders and epilepsy. Recent work has demonstrated that lithium and valproic acid could reduce A\u03b2 levels and improve cognitive performance in mouse models of AD (54, 68). While the inhibitory effects of lithium and valproic acid on GSK3 are known, both compounds have also been found to affect signaling cascades independent of GSK3. To further investigate the role of GSK3 on APP processing, we administered ARA, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of GSK3 (IC50 = 104 \u00b1 27 nM) (73) to APP Swedish stable cell lines and APP23/PS45 mice. We found that with specific GSK3 inhibition, the BACE1 major product C99 is reduced, accompanied by a significant reduction in A\u03b2 levels. Previous reports indicated that ARA treatment reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and tangle formation in transgenic mice overexpressing human tau, a model of AD (62). Our study shows that ARA also reduces plaque pathology and rescues cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model. However, continuous ARA treatment is required in order to reduce plaque pathology, as APP23/PS45 mice sacrificed 3 months after the last injection had plaque levels similar to those in the control group. Previous work by Phiel et al. (51) demonstrated that inhibition of GSK3\u03b1 with isoform-specific siRNA decreases \u03b3-secretase activity but found no effect of GSK3\u03b2. In our study, we found that in a system in which \u03b3-secretase activity is pharmacologically inhibited, GSK3\u03b1 knockdown did not have any significant effect on APP processing. On the other hand, GSK3\u03b2 knockdown with inhibition of \u03b3-secretase activity reduced the level of C99 fragment, indicating that BACE1 activity is affected. We further provided evidence that knocking down GSK3\u03b2 reduced BACE1 mRNA levels, but knocking down GSK3\u03b1 did not affect BACE1 expression. Previous genetic studies have found that during development GSK3\u03b1 could not compensate for the loss of GSK3\u03b2, as Gsk3b-KO mice are embryonic lethal while Gsk3a-KO mice are viable (61). This argues that GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 isoforms may have distinct cellular functions with respect to BACE1 expression. Moreover, GSK3\u03b2 is the predominant isoform in the brain and therefore has been implicated in many CNS disorders (74). However, Jaworski et al. recently showed the GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 knockout mice did not show any changes to APP processing and A\u03b2 production (52). This could be due to a physiological compensation of BACE1 expression in the KO mice compared with the acute effect of the GSK3 inhibitor. Additionally, our data showed that GSK3\u03b2 regulated NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated BACE1 expression. Gsk3a knockout had no effect on NF-\u03baB signaling. Taken together, these studies suggest that GSK3 isoforms have distinct roles in regulating APP processing. We do not believe that gene silencing of GSK3 isoforms would be a valid approach for treating AD. Complete ablation of each isoform may lead to compensatory elevated activity of the other isoform or even other functionally protein kinases. Moreover, it has been reported that complete ablation of GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 expression in mice results in various abnormalities (75), which may interfere with any therapeutic values. Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested a significant inflammatory component in AD (76\u201379). However, it remains controversial whether neuroinflammation is a driving force for AD or simply a byproduct of the disease (80). Moreover, the detrimental role of astrocyte and microglia during neuroinflammation remains elusive. The release of various proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines has been shown to affect APP processing, A\u03b2 production, and neurodegenerative changes in AD brains. There have been preclinical studies to show that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or anti-inflammatory cytokines have beneficial effects in treating AD (80, 81). However, there are reports demonstrating that anti-inflammatory stimuli could potentiate A\u03b2 production, possibly through suppression of glia-mediated A\u03b2 clearance. On the other hand, proinflammatory stimuli could also have extreme effects on AD pathogenesis. There is a large amount of evidence to show that increased proinflammatory cytokines correlates with A\u03b2 production and neurodegeneration. In contrast, there are also a number of studies indicating that proinflammatory cytokines precondition the system for A\u03b2 challenge and protect against neurodegeneration (82\u201385). Clearly, inflammation is a major component of the AD brain, and more work will be required in order to elucidate its role in AD pathogenesis. Since several proinflammatory cytokines including the interleukins and TNF have been found to activate GSK3\u03b2, and GSK3 inhibitors showed anti-inflammatory effects (86\u201388), we speculate that GSK3 plays an important role in the inflammatory response driving A\u03b2 production. The chronic inflammatory response induced by A\u03b2 may depend on transcription factors to exert neurodegenerative effects. Regulation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and its transcriptional activity may in part play a role in A\u03b2-mediated neurodegeneration (27, 89). It has been previously reported that the BACE1 promoter contains NF-\u03baB\u2013binding elements (27, 90) and exacerbated A\u03b2 levels modulate the BACE1 promoter activity via NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent pathways (91). More recently, Chen et al. (27) found increased NF-\u03baB p65 and BACE1 expression in postmortem AD brains. Furthermore, overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 was found to increase human BACE1 promoter activity, whereas inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling reduced BACE1 expression (27). Exogenous application of A\u03b2 has been found to increase GSK3\u03b2 activity and NF-\u03baB levels. There are many reports suggesting that GSK3\u03b2 regulates gene transcription in an NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent manner (61, 92, 93). Therefore, we argue that the GSK3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is involved in regulating BACE1 gene transcription. In this study, we found that interfering with GSK3\u03b2 activity using Gsk3b-KO cells or ARA treatment reduced BACE1 promoter activity and gene expression. Moreover, disrupting NF-\u03baB expression also blocked GSK3\u03b2-induced BACE1 transcription. Long-term treatment with GSK3 inhibitors always raises the concern about unwanted side effects. Many of the Wnt signal transduction components such as the APC gene or \u03b2-catenin gene carry mutations that render the protein nondegradable (94). Prolonged activation of the Wnt pathway has been linked to development of various cancers (95). GSK3 inhibitors including SB216763, SB415286, Kenpaullone, and lithium chloride have all been shown to elevate the level of \u03b2-catenin (51, 96, 97). Consequently, it may be possible that GSK3 inhibitors may mimic Wnt signaling and could potentially be oncogenic. However, long-term use of lithium chloride to treat bipolar disorder has not been linked to increased risk of cancer. Interestingly, administration of the GSK3 inhibitors CHIR99021 and ARA did not change \u03b2-catenin levels (65). Moreover, \u03b2-catenin levels are largely unaffected in Gsk3b-KO embryos (61). These findings indicate that the inhibition of GSK3 by itself might not be sufficient to elevate the level of \u03b2-catenin. It is possible that there are specific pools of GSK3 that are insensitive to certain GSK3 inhibitors, thereby sparing the effect of increasing \u03b2-catenin levels. In order to validate the therapeutic efficacy of GSK3 inhibition, while minimizing oncogenic side effects, long-term treatment studies in cells and animals will be required. In conclusion, we have found that the GSK3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway regulates BACE1 transcription and thereby facilitates A\u03b2 production in AD. Since GSK3\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB are involved in AD pathogenesis, our results suggest that direct interference of this pathway may be a promising drug target for AD therapy. MethodsCell culture, transfection, and ARA treatment. All cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in an incubator containing 5% CO2. HEK293 (human embryonic kidney), N2a (mouse neuroblastoma), SHSY5Y (human neuroblastoma), and wild-type MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) were maintained in complete DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Gsk3b-KO fibroblast cells were derived from E12.5 Gsk3b-KO mouse embryos and were maintained in complete DMEM (61). The 20E2 cell line is a Swedish mutant APP695 stable HEK293 cell line cultured in complete DMEM with 50 \u03bcg/ml geneticin (98). 293B2 cells stably expressing human BACE1 in HEK293 cell line were cultured in complete DMEM with 100 \u03bcg/ml Zeocin (99). The RelA-KO fibroblast cell line, derived from E12.5\u2013E14.5 mouse embryo fibroblasts, was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and ESGRO (LIF) (100). S9A-GSK3\u03b2 stably transfected SHSY5Y cells, under the control of the tetracycline-regulated mammalian expression T-Rex system (Invitrogen), were maintained in complete DMEM (60). S9A-GSK3\u03b2 gene induction was achieved by stimulation with 1 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline (60). Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using either calcium phosphate or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). L685,458, G2, and ARA (EMD Biosciences) were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with complete cell culture medium. The final DMSO concentrations in each experiment were less than 0.5%. Luciferase assay. BACE1 promoter constructs were transfected into N2a cells and wild-type and Gsk3b-KO MEFs. The Renilla (sea pansy) luciferase vector pCMV-Rluc was co-transfected to normalize transfection efficiency. A luciferase assay was performed 48 hours after transfection with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) as previously described (27). Semiquantitative RT-PCR. RNA was isolated from cells using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). A Thermoscript Reverse Transcription kit (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA from an equal amount of RNA following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The newly synthesized cDNA templates were further amplified via Platinum Taq DNA polymerase in a 20-\u03bcl reaction. The following primers were used to specifically amplify BACE1, GSK3A, GSK3B, APP, and PS1 genes: BACE1 forward 5\u2032-cccgcagacgctcaacatcc and reverse 5\u2032-GCCACTGTCCACAATGCTCTT; GSK3A forward 5\u2032-TGAAGCTGGGCCGTGACAGCGG and reverse 5\u2032-ACATGTACACCTTGACATAG; GSK3B forward 5\u2032-TCAGGAGTGCGGGTCTTCCGAC and reverse 5\u2032-CTCCAGTATTAGCATCTGACGCT; APP forward 5\u2032-GCTGGCCTGCTGGCTGAACC and reverse 5\u2032-GGCGACGGTGTGCCAGTGAA; PS1 forward 5\u2032-GAGACACAGGACAGTGGTTCTGG and reverse 5\u2032-GGCCGATCAGTATGGCTACAAA. \u03b2-Actin was used as an internal control. The samples were resolved and analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel. Immunoblot analysis. Brain tissues or cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 4% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) supplemented with 200 mM sodium orthovanadate, 25 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM PMSF, and a complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche Diagnostics). The samples were diluted in 4\u00d7 SDS-sample buffer, boiled, and resolved on 12% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE or 16% Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvindylidine fluoride (PVDF-FL) membranes. For immunoblot analysis, membranes were blocked for 1 hour in PBS containing 5% nonfat dried milk, followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C in primary antibodies diluted in the blocking medium. Rabbit anti-APP C-terminal polyclonal antibody C20 was used to detect APP and its CTF products. PS1 was detected by anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody 231. Total GSK3\u03b2 was determined using a pan-specific mouse anti-GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 antibody (BioSource International Inc.). Total \u03b2-catenin was determined using a pan-specific rabbit anti\u2013\u03b2-catenin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). The NF-\u03baB p65 subunit was determined using mouse anti-p65 (Sigma-Aldrich). Internal control \u03b2-actin was analyzed using monoclonal antibody AC-15 (Sigma-Aldrich). BACE1 was detected with the anti-BACE1 antibody 208 recognizing the C-terminal end (101). A\u03b240/42 ELISA. HEK293 cells stably expressing the human APP gene containing the Swedish mutation were maintained in cell culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS. Following ARA treatment for 24 hours, conditioned medium was harvested, and protease inhibitors and AEBSF (Roche Diagnostics) were added to prevent degradation of A\u03b2 peptides. APP23/PS45 double transgenic mouse cortical tissues were prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions prior to carrying out the ELISA protocol (Invitrogen). The concentration of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 were detected using an A\u03b21\u201340 or A\u03b21\u201342 Colorimetric ELISA kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. EMSA. Whole brain extracts were prepared by homogenizing the tissue in Buffer C (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitor. EMSA was performed as previously described with a few changes (102). Briefly, 20\u201340 \u03bcg protein was incubated with an IRDye 700\u2013labeled NF-\u03baB oligo (5\u2032-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC), and the gels were scanned using the Odyssey system (LI-COR Biosciences). In the competition assay, unlabeled wild-type and mutant (5\u2032-AGTTGAGGCCACTTTCCCAGGC) NF-\u03baB oligos at \u00d710 and \u00d7100 molar excess were used to compete for binding. Transgenic mice and drug treatment. APP23 mice overexpressing the Swedish APP751 (KM\u2192NL) mutant transgene driven by the mouse Thy1.2 promoter were originally generated at Novartis Pharma as previously described (30, 103). APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice were generated by crossing APP23 mice with mice overexpressing the human G384A-mutated PS1 under the control of the murine Thy1 promoter (B6,D2-TgN(Thy1-PS1G384A)45) (54, 103\u2013105). APP23 and PS45 mice had been backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice for more than 7 generations prior to breeding for the double transgenic mice. The genotype of the mice was confirmed by PCR using DNA from tail tissues. The treatment group contained 14 animals (8 females, 6 males), and the sham-injected group contained 12 animals (7 females, 5 males). The treatment group received 5 mg/kg ARA diluted in 0.9% saline daily via intraperitoneal injection at the same time each day. Mice in the control group were injected with the vehicle solution containing DMSO diluted in 0.9% saline only. We tabulated the daily food consumption and weight for each mouse. Immunohistochemical staining. Mice were sacrificed after behavioral testing, and half brains were immediately homogenized for protein, RNA, or DNA extraction. The other halves of the brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned with a Leica Cryostat to 30-\u03bcm thickness. Every twelfth slice with the same reference position was mounted onto slides for staining. Immunocytochemical staining was performed on floating sections. The plaques in the sections were detected with biotinylated monoclonal 4G8 antibody (Signetlabs) in 1:500 dilution, visualized by the ABC and DAB method, and counted under a \u00d740 objective as previously described (54, 63). Plaques were quantified, and the average plaque count per slice was recorded for each mouse. Thioflavin-S staining of plaques was performed with 1% thioflavin-S visualized using fluorescence microscopy (54). Morris water maze test. The Morris water maze test was performed as previously described (30, 64). The APP23/PS45 mice treated with or without ARA were subjected to the Morris water maze test 1 day after the last injection regimen. The test was performed in a 1.5-meter-diameter pool with a 10-cm-diameter platform placed in the SE quadrant of the pool. The procedure consisted of 1 day of visible platform tests and 4 days of hidden platform tests, plus a probe trial 24 hours after the last hidden platform test. In the visible platform test performed on the first day, the mice were tested for 5 continuous trials, with an inter-trial interval of 60 minutes. In the hidden platform tests, mice were trained for 5 trials, with an inter-trial interval of 1 hour. Each mouse was allowed 60 seconds to search for the platform. In the scenario where the mouse could not locate the platform, the experiment guided it to the platform and allowed the mouse to rest there for 15 seconds. On the last day of the test, each mouse was subjected to the probe trial in which the platform was removed. Each mouse was given 60 seconds to locate where the platform was originally placed. Mouse behavior including distance traveled, escape latency and the number of passes through the platform was recorded by automated video tracking (ANY-maze, Stoelting). The data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. Statistics. All results were presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and analyzed by ANOVA or 2-tailed Student\u2019s t-test. Statistical significance is accepted when P < 0.05. Study approval. Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the University of British Columbia Animal Care and Use Committee and Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) guidelines.Supplemental dataView Supplemental dataAcknowledgmentsWe thank Steven R.

First published December 3, 2012Received for publication April 26, 2012, and accepted in revised form September 27, 2012.Deposition of amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) to form neuritic plaques in the brain is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). A\u03b2 is generated from sequential cleavages of the \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases, and \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the \u03b2-secretase essential for A\u03b2 generation. Previous studies have indicated that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) may play a role in APP processing by modulating \u03b3-secretase activity, thereby facilitating A\u03b2 production. There are two highly conserved isoforms of GSK3: GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2. We now report that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production by decreasing BACE1 gene transcription and expression. The regulation of BACE1 gene expression by GSK3\u03b2 was dependent on NF-\u03baB signaling. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling markedly reduced A\u03b2 deposition and neuritic plaque formation, and rescued memory deficits in the double transgenic AD model mice. These data provide evidence for regulation of BACE1 expression and AD pathogenesis by GSK3\u03b2 and that inhibition of GSK3 signaling can reduce A\u03b2 neuropathology and alleviate memory deficits in AD model mice. Our study suggests that interventions that specifically target the \u03b2-isoform of GSK3 may be a safe and effective approach for treating AD. IntroductionAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia. The characteristic neuropathological features of AD include neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2), the central component of neuritic plaques, is produced from sequential endoproteolytic cleavages of the type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase. Proteolytic processing of APP at the \u03b2 site is essential for generating A\u03b2, and \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the \u03b2-secretase in vivo (1\u20134). BACE1 cleaves APP at two \u03b2-sites, Asp+1 and Glu+11 of the A\u03b2 domain, to generate C99 and C89 fragment, respectively (5). Subsequently, \u03b3-secretase cleaves C99 within its transmembrane domain to release A\u03b2 and APP C-terminal fragment \u03b3 (CTF\u03b3). In addition to APP, BACE1 substrates also include other proteins: LRP (6), APLP1 (7), APLP2 (8), ST6Gal I (9), and PSGL-1 (10). BACE1 expression is tightly regulated at the level of transcription (5, 11, 12) and translation (13\u201316). It was reported that a G/C polymorphism in exon 5 of the BACE1 gene might be associated with some sporadic cases of AD (17\u201319). Although genetic analyses from our and other laboratories have failed to uncover any mutation in the BACE1 coding sequence or any disease-associated SNP in its promoter region in AD patients (20\u201322), increased \u03b2-secretase levels and activity have been reported in AD (23\u201327). BACE1 levels were elevated in neurons around plaques (28). BACE1 mRNA levels tended to increase as miR-107 levels decreased in the progression of AD (29). We reported that hypoxia, a common vascular component among AD risk factors, increased BACE1 expression, resulting in both increased A\u03b2 deposition and memory deficits in AD transgenic mice (30). Recently we found that both NF-\u03baB and BACE1 levels were increased in sporadic AD patients, and NF-\u03baB facilitated BACE1 gene expression and APP processing (27). Thus, increased BACE1 expression by NF-\u03baB signaling in the brain could be one of the mechanisms underlying AD development (27). Together, these studies indicate that BACE1 dysregulation plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. BACE1 has been considered as one of the major targets for AD drug development. Bace1-knockout mice have abolished A\u03b2 generation (31\u201333). Suppression of BACE1 by RNA interference reduced APP processing and A\u03b2 production in primary cortical neurons derived from both wild-type and Swedish APP mutant transgenic mice (34), and disruption of the Bace1 gene rescued memory deficits and cholinergic dysfunction in Swedish APP mice (35). Oral administration of a potent and selective BACE1 inhibitor decreased \u03b2-cleavage and A\u03b2 production in APP transgenic mice in vivo (36). Bace1-KO mice were reported to display hypomyelination of peripheral nerves and aberrant axonal segregation (37, 38), suggesting that inhibiting \u03b2-secretase may have unwanted collateral effects. However, even a partial reduction in BACE1 can have dramatically beneficial effects on AD pathology (39), suggesting that therapeutic inhibition of BACE1 is a valid therapeutic target for AD treatment. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinase originally identified as playing an important role in glycogen metabolism. Since its discovery, many studies have shown that GSK3 has pleiotropic functions, including embryonic development, gene transcription, and neuronal cell function (40). In mammals, two GSK3 isoforms are encoded by distinct genes: GSK3A produces a 51-kDa GSK3\u03b1 protein and GSK3B a 47-kDa GSK3\u03b2 protein (41). These two isoforms are highly homologous, sharing greater than 95% amino acid identity in the catalytic domains. Although both isoforms are ubiquitously expressed, the \u03b2 isoform is expressed at higher levels in neuronal tissues (42). GSK3 activity is regulated at several levels. Phosphorylation of Tyr279/Tyr216 on GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 is important for enzymatic activity (43). Inactivation of GSK3 can be achieved through phosphorylation of Ser21/Ser9 residues within the N-terminal domain on GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2, respectively. Stimulation of tissues by insulin and growth factors activates the PI3K/PKB/Akt signal transduction cascade, leading to phosphorylation of these inhibitory serine residues (44, 45). GSK3 is also regulated upon interaction of the Wnt ligand and its receptor Frizzled and co-receptor LRP5/6. This interaction releases GSK3 from a multi-protein complex formed by \u03b2-catenin, axin, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (46, 47), which prevents GSK3-mediated \u03b2-catenin degradation and induces \u03b2-catenin\u2013dependent gene transcription. Dysregulation of GSK3 activity has been implicated in AD. Increased GSK3\u03b2 activity was found in postmortem AD brains (48). GSK3\u03b2 has been found to phosphorylate the tau protein on various conserved sites and contribute to tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation (49, 50). GSK3\u03b1 was reported to regulate A\u03b2 production by positively modulating the \u03b3-secretase complex (51), although this finding has recently been challenged (52). Inhibition of GSK3 activity with the commonly known GSK3 inhibitors LiCl and valproic acid in cell culture (53) and animal models of AD decreased A\u03b2 production (51, 54). Although LiCl and valproic acid are known to inhibit GSK3 activity, these compounds also activate a plethora of signaling cascades that could differentially regulate APP processing independent of GSK3 (55\u201358). In this study, we examined the effects of GSK3\u03b2-specific inhibition on AD neuropathology and behavioral deficits and identified its underlying mechanism. We found that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP. Treatment with the GSK3 inhibitor AR-A014418 (ARA) reduced neuritic plaque formation and alleviated memory deficits in AD transgenic model mice. Furthermore, we found that GSK3\u03b2 regulated BACE1 transcription via NF-\u03baB signaling. Our work provides evidence that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 may be an effective therapeutic approach for treating AD. ResultsRegulation of \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production by GSK3 signaling. Previous studies showed that LiCl and valproic acid modulated GSK3 signaling and reduced A\u03b2 production (51, 54). However, the underlying mechanism is not well defined, and these compounds also have many confounding GSK3-independent effects. To examine the specific effect of GSK3 signaling on APP processing, we applied ARA, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of GSK3, to 20E2 cells, a stable cell line expressing human Swedish mutant APP (5). ARA at 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM significantly decreased the levels of the \u03b2-secretase cleavage product APP C99 to 95.7% \u00b1 1.6%, 66.4% \u00b1 0.7%, and 31.3% \u00b1 0.4%, respectively (P < 0.001 by 1-way ANOVA) (Figure 1A and B). The treatment had no significant effect on APP expression (Figure 1A). The A\u03b2 ELISA was performed to assess the levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 in the conditioned media of 20E2 cells. ARA markedly reduced A\u03b2 generation in a dose-dependent manner. A\u03b240 was decreased to 99.2% \u00b1 3.8%, 73.2% \u00b1 4.6%, and 48.7% \u00b1 1.3% with 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM of ARA treatment, respectively (P < 0.05) (Figure 1C); and A\u03b242 was reduced to 99.2% \u00b1 3.1%, 73.2% \u00b1 3.5%, and 48.7% \u00b1 4.5% with 1, 2.5 and 5 \u03bcM of ARA treatment, respectively (P < 0.01 by 1-way ANOVA) (Figure 1D). As expected, inhibition of GSK3 stabilized \u03b2-catenin (Figure 1A), and ARA treatment resulted in a significant increase in \u03b2-catenin levels to 152.7% \u00b1 11.1%, 221.3% \u00b1 17.0%, and 233.7% \u00b1 25.0% with 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM, respectively (P < 0.05). These data indicate that specifically inhibiting GSK3 reduced BACE1-mediated APP processing and C99 and A\u03b2 production. Specific inhibition of GSK3 reduces BACE1 cleavage of APP.Figure 1Specific inhibition of GSK3 reduces BACE1 cleavage of APP. (A) Swedish mutant APP stable cell line 20E2 was cultured and treated with ARA for 24 hours, and cell lysates subjected to Western blot analysis. Full-length APP and the APP CTFs were detected with C20 antibody. \u03b2-Catenin was detected by anti\u2013\u03b2-catenin antibody. \u03b2-Actin was detected by anti-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control.

A\u03b2 ELISA detection of A\u03b240 (C) and A\u03b242 (D) in conditioned medium from 20E2 cells treated with ARA for 24 hours.

(F) Quantification of C99 levels. n = 6; *P < 0.05, ANOVA. To further examine the effect of GSK3 on \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production, we pharmacologically blocked \u03b3-secretase activity with the \u03b3-secretase\u2013specific inhibitor L658,458 in 20E2 cells while co-treating with the GSK3 inhibitor ARA and G2. G2 is another structurally distinct GSK3 inhibitor, with an IC50 of 304 nM (59). As expected, \u03b3-secretase inhibition resulted in markedly increased generation of the APP CTFs C83 and C99 (Figure 1E). Addition of ARA or G2 reduced C99 levels to 78.2% \u00b1 1.1% and 63.9% \u00b1 6.6% (Figure 1, E and F). ARA treatment had no significant effect on Notch cleavage (Supplemental Figure 1B; supplemental material available online with this article; doi: 10.1172/JCI64516DS1). These data demonstrated that specific inhibition of GSK3 reduced \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP to generate C99 and A\u03b2 production in cells. GSK3\u03b2 but not GSK3\u03b1 regulates BACE1 gene expression and BACE1-mediated APP processing. Our study has shown that GSK3 regulated \u03b2-secretase processing of APP, an essential step for A\u03b2 generation. Since BACE1 is the \u03b2-secretase in vivo, we first examined whether GSK3 affects BACE1 gene expression. GSK3 has two highly homologous isoforms, GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2. We used RNA interference to specifically knock down the expression of GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 isoforms in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to determine whether both isoforms or one of the isoforms play a major role in regulating BACE1 gene expression. Specific knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 expression by the siRNA significantly reduced BACE1 mRNA levels to 76.0% \u00b1 6.6% as compared with control (P < 0.05) (Figure 2, A and B), whereas knockdown of GSK3\u03b1 did not affect BACE1 mRNA expression (P > 0.05) (Figure 2, A and B). Additional exogenous expression of GSK3\u03b2 rescued the reduction of BACE1 expression resulting from knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 by siRNA (Supplemental Figure 2). To examine whether specific knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 expression also affected \u03b2-secretase processing of APP, we transfected siRNA specific to GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 into 20E2 cells while inhibiting \u03b3-secretase activity with L658,458. Western blotting showed that GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 siRNA specifically reduced GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 expression, respectively (Figure 2C). Knockdown of GSK3\u03b1 expression did not significantly affect BACE1-mediated APP processing, whereas GSK3\u03b2 knockdown reduced the production of the BACE1 cleavage product C99 to 51.9% \u00b1 6.4% (P < 0.05) (Figure 2, C and D). GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, regulates BACE1 gene expression and APP processing.Figure 2GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, regulates BACE1 gene expression and APP processing. (A) SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were transfected with scrambled GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 isoform\u2013specific siRNA. RNA was extracted, and semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed to measure endogenous human BACE1, GSK3A, GSK3B, and \u03b2-actin mRNA levels with specific primers recognizing the coding sequence of each gene. PCR products after 28 cycles were analyzed on 1.2% agarose gel. (B) Endogenous BACE1 mRNA was significantly reduced with GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, isoform\u2013specific knockdown. The values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 3; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. (C) 20E2 cells were transfected with scrambled or GSK3\u03b1, or GSK3\u03b2 isoform\u2013specific siRNA while cotreated with L685,458 to block \u03b3-secretase activity. Full-length APP and CTF fragments were detected with C20 antibody. GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 were detected using a monoclonal GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 antibody. GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 isoforms were selectively reduced by the isoform-specific siRNA. \u03b2-Actin served as an internal control and was detected using a monoclonal anti\u2013\u03b2-actin antibody, AC-15. (D) GSK3\u03b2-specific knockdown significantly reduced C99 levels. GSK3\u03b1-specific knockdown did not have any significant effect. The values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. (E) Tetracycline-regulated SHSY5Y cells were induced to express constitutively active S9A-GSK3\u03b2. Endogenous human BACE1 mRNA levels were assessed as described above. Tetracyline-induced S9A-GSK3\u03b2 significantly increased BACE1 expression. (F) Quantification of the endogenous BACE1 mRNA level. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. To further confirm that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene expression at the transcription level, we assayed BACE1 mRNA in the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 inducible SHSY5Y stable cell line. This stable cell line carries the constitutively active mutant GSK3\u03b2, and expression of the mutant gene is under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (60). Addition of tetracycline induced the expression of active GSK3\u03b2 (Figure 2E) and resulted in significantly increased expression of BACE1 to 251.1% \u00b1 70.0% relative to the control (P < 0.05) (Figure 2F). These data demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, specifically regulates BACE1 gene expression and contribute to APP processing. GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene promoter activity. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 gene expression at the transcription level, we performed a BACE1 gene promoter assay. Two human BACE1 gene promoter deletion plasmids were constructed. Regions of the BACE1 promoter from \u20132890 to +292 bp (pB1-A) and from \u20139 to +292 bp (pB1-B) were inserted into promoterless vector pGL3-basic upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Figure 3A). To examine the effect of GSK3 on BACE1 gene promoter activity, we transfected N2a cells with pB1-A and then treated them with ARA. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling by ARA significantly decreased the promoter activity of pB1-A in N2a cells to 54.9% \u00b1 6.2% (P < 0.005) (Figure 3B). To further investigate the underlying mechanism and determine the BACE1 promoter region that mediates the transcriptional activation by GSK3 signaling, we co-transfected N2a cells with either pB1-A or pB1-B plasmid together with the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 plasmid, which carries a constitutively active form of GSK3\u03b2. Expression of active GSK3\u03b2 markedly increased the luciferase activity of pB1-A in the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 transfected cells to 144.0% \u00b1 2.0% as compared with the control (P < 0.05), but had no significant effect on the luciferase activity of pB1-B (P > 0.05) (Figure 3C). This result showed that enhancing GSK3\u03b2 signaling upregulated BACE1 gene promoter activity and the 2.8-kb promoter region is responsible for GSK3\u03b2-mediated upregulation of BACE1 transcription. To further confirm this finding, we transfected these two deletion promoter plasmids into Gsk3b-KO or wild-type cells. Ablation of Gsk3b expression in the Gsk3b-KO cells resulted in significant reduction in luciferase activity of pB1-A to 47.0% \u00b1 7.5% as compared with the wild-type control cells (P < 0.01) (Figure 3D). However, knockout of the Gsk3b gene had no significant effect on the luciferase activity of pB1-B (Figure 3D). Taken together, these results demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene expression via its effect on the BACE1 promoter. GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 promoter activation.Figure 3GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 promoter activation. (A) Schematic of the 3.3-kb (pB1-A) and 300-bp (pB1-B) human BACE1 promoter/luciferase construct. (B) The 3.5-kb human BACE1 promoter was transfected into N2a cells and treated with 5 \u03bcM ARA. GSK3 inhibition with ARA treatment resulted in a significant decrease in luciferase activity. (C) N2a cells were co-transfected with either promoter constructs and S9A-GSK3\u03b2 or a vector control. S9A-GSK3\u03b2 significantly increased the luciferase activity of the 3.3-kb BACE1 promoter construct but did not have any effect on the 300-bp promoter construct. (D) pB1-A or pB1-B constructs were transfected into Gsk3b-KO MEFs. pB1-A had significantly reduced promoter activity. All promoter data shown represent an average of at least 4 independent experiments, with each condition performed in triplicate.

Recently we reported that levels of both BACE1 and NF-\u03baB are increased in AD brains, and NF-\u03baB signaling upregulates human BACE1 gene expression by acting on the cis-acting p65-binding element in its promoter (27). Previous studies in Gsk3b-KO mice demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2 is required for proper activation of NF-\u03baB (61). As our data indicate that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene transcription, we next examined whether regulation of BACE1 transcription by GSK3\u03b2 signaling is dependent on NF-\u03baB. TNF-\u03b1 is a strong activator of NF-\u03baB p65 expression. In order to examine the specific role of NF-\u03baB in GSK3\u03b2-regulated BACE1 transcription, we transfected N2a cells with a pBACE1-4\u03baB promoter plasmid that contained only the NF-\u03baB\u2013binding elements in the human BACE1 promoter (27). After transfection, the cells were cotreated with TNF-\u03b1 and the GSK3 inhibitor ARA. ARA treatment alone consistently reduced BACE1 promoter activity (Figure 4A). TNF-\u03b1 stimulation increased pB1A promoter activity to 132.6% \u00b1 7.5% of the control (P < 0.01). However, ARA treatment reduced the TNF-\u03b1\u2013induced BACE1 promoter activation to 115.6 \u00b1 6.9% as compared with TNF-\u03b1 treatment alone (P < 0.05) (Figure 4A). Overexpression of p65 NF-\u03baB significantly increased the BACE1 promoter activity to 487.1% \u00b1 102.2% as compared with the control (P < 0.001) (Figure 3D). However, ARA did not affect NF-\u03baB p65\u2019s upregulating effect on BACE1 promoter activity (P > 0.05), indicating that GSK3 signaling may have its effect upstream of NF-\u03baB in the modulation of BACE1 transcription (Figure 4B). To further confirm ARA\u2019s effect on NF-\u03baB activity, we co-transfected N2a cells with pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc and NF-\u03baB p65 or an empty vector, followed by treatment with ARA to inhibit GSK3 signaling. ARA reduced pNF-\u03baB-Luc promoter activity to 51.9% \u00b1 9.1% as compared with control (P < 0.05) (Figure 4C). Overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 significantly increased pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc promoter activity to 203.36 \u00b1 87.38\u2013fold (P < 0.001) (Figure 4C). Additional ARA treatment did not have any significant effect on the transcriptional activation of pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc by NF-\u03baB p65 overexpression (P > 0.05) (Figure 4C). These data indicate that the p65-binding elements in the BACE1 promoter mediated the effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 transcription. GSK3\u03b2 regulation of BACE1 transcription is dependent on NF-\u03baB p65 expressioFigure 4GSK3\u03b2 regulation of BACE1 transcription is dependent on NF-\u03baB p65 expression. (A) pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB plasmid contains the 4 NF-\u03baB cis-elements from the human BACE1 promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. N2a cells were co-transfected with pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB and pCMV-RLuc. Transfected cells were treated with vehicle solution (control) or 10 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 with/without 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours.

S9A-GSK3\u03b2 overexpression in MEFs. significantly increased luciferase activity (*P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test), whereas RelA-KO MEFs did not have any significant effect. Luciferase activity is indicative of BACE1 promoter activity. All promoter data shown represent an average of at least 4 independent experiments, with each condition performed in triplicate.

To confirm the role of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in GSK3\u03b2-mediated BACE1 transcription, we transfected NF-\u03baB p65 knockout RelA-KO cells and wild-type control cells with the BACE1 promoter pB1-A and the constitutively active GSK3\u03b2 expression plasmid S9A-GSK3\u03b2. In wild-type cells, activation of GSK3\u03b2 signaling by expression of S9A-GSK3\u03b2 markedly increased BACE1 promoter activity to 189.6% \u00b1 20.9% as compared with the vector control (P < 0.05), whereas activation of GSK3\u03b2 signaling by expression of S9A-GSK3\u03b2 had no effect on BACE1 promoter activity in RelA-KO cells (P > 0.05) (Figure 4D), indicating that disruption of NF-\u03baB p65 expression in RelA-KO cells abolished GSK3\u03b2\u2019s effect on the transcriptional activation of the human BACE1 gene promoter. To further examine the effect of GSK3 inhibition on NF-\u03baB p65 expression, we treated N2a cells with ARA and subjected them to subcellular fractionation (Figure 4E). ARA treatment significantly reduced nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 levels to 46.9% \u00b1 9.1% as compared with control (P < 0.01) (Figure 4F). Moreover, ARA treatment also reduced cytosolic NF-\u03baB p65 levels to 56.1% \u00b1 7.1% as compared with control (P < 0.001) (Figure 4G). These data show that GSK3 inhibition with ARA reduced NF-\u03baB activity by decreasing NF-\u03baB p65 levels. Taken together, our results demonstrate that NF-\u03baB signaling mediates the regulatory effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 gene expression. GSK3 regulates BACE1 gene expression, APP processing, and A\u03b2 production in vivo. Our data provide strong evidence that GSK3\u03b2 activates BACE1 gene expression, resulting in enhanced \u03b2-secretase processing of APP and A\u03b2 production in vitro. To examine the effect of GSK3 signaling on BACE1 gene expression and APP processing in vivo, we first assayed APP CTFs and A\u03b2 production in the brain of APP23/PS45 mice by Western blot analysis (Figure 5, A and B). APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice, an AD mouse model, were generated by crossing APP23 mice, carrying the human Swedish mutant APP751 transgene driven by the neuron-specific Thy1.2 promoter, and PS45 mice, carrying the human familial AD\u2013associated G384A mutant presenilin-1 (PS1) (54). The mice were treated with 5 mg/kg of the GSK3 inhibitor ARA at 6 weeks of age daily for 4 weeks, while age-matched control mice received vehicle solution. ARA treatment significantly decreased the brain levels of the \u03b2-secretase\u2013generated CTF\u03b2 fragments C99 and C89, to 38.4% \u00b1 4.8% relative to controls (P < 0.05) (Figure 5B). The levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 were reduced to 71.2% \u00b1 8.3% and 65.6% \u00b1 11.0% in ARA-treated mice relative to controls, (P < 0.05) (Figure 5, C and D). These data demonstrate that inhibition of GSK3 activity by ARA treatment reduces \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo. ARA inhibits BACE1 cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo.Figure 5ARA inhibits BACE1 cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo. (A) Hemi-brains from ARA-treated and control APP23/PS45 mice of the 6 weeks age group were homogenized in RIPA-Doc lysis buffer and separated with 12% Tris-glycine or 16% Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE. Full-length APP and APP CTFs (C99 and C89) were detected by C20 polyclonal antibody. PS1 was detected by anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody 231. BACE1 was detected by anti-BACE1 antibody. \u03b2-Actin was detected by anti\u2013\u03b2-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control. (B) Quantification showed that CTF\u03b2 was significantly decreased in ARA-treated mice. n = 25 mice total. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, Student\u2019s t test. ELISA was performed to measure A\u03b240 (C) and A\u03b242 (D) levels from the brain tissues of APP23/PS45 mice injected with or without ARA. n = 8 for each group; *P < 0.005, Student\u2019s t test. (E) Total RNA was isolated from APP23/PS45 mouse cortices by TRI Reagent. Sets of gene-specific primers were used to amplify Bace1 (E), PS1 (G), and App (I) genes. \u03b2-Actin was used as an internal control. Bace1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced (F), while there were no difference in endogenous PS1 (H) or App (J) mRNA levels between ARA-treated mice and controls. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 12 total; *P < 0.01, Student\u2019s t test. We then examined whether the level of BACE1 was altered by GSK3 signaling in vivo. Western blot analysis showed that inhibition of GSK3 signaling significantly reduced the protein level of BACE1 to 64.7% \u00b1 7.3% in ARA-treated mice, as compared with the control mice (P < 0.01), and the treatment had no significant effect on APP and PS1 protein levels (P > 0.05) (Figure 5, A and B). We further showed that GSK3 inhibition with ARA reduced tau phosphorylation, which is consistent with previous findings (ref. 62 and Supplemental Figure 1A). Our in vitro study has shown that GSK3\u03b2 regulates the transcription of the BACE1 gene. To confirm that the decrease in BACE1 protein level seen in the brains of the ARA-treated mice was due to reduced BACE1 gene transcription, the endogenous Bace1 mRNA levels were measured (Figure 5, E, G, and I). ARA treatment markedly reduced Bace1 mRNA level to 36.7% \u00b1 11.8% (P < 0.01) (Figure 5F), but did not significantly change the mRNA levels of App and PS1 genes (P > 0.05) (Figure 5, H and J). These data demonstrate that, consistent with the in vitro results, inhibition of GSK3 specifically inhibited Bace1 gene expression and its \u03b2-secretase activity in vivo. Our study has demonstrated that NF-\u03baB signaling is required for GSK3\u03b2\u2019s regulatory effect on BACE1 gene expression in vitro. To confirm this effect in vivo, we examined whether NF-\u03baB activity was affected in APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice administered ARA. EMSA was used to assess NF-\u03baB consensus DNA binding in whole brain lysates. ARA treatment inhibited the binding of NF-\u03baB p65 protein to the cis-acting consensus oligonucleotide probe, resulting in a reduction in the intensity of the p65 NF-\u03baB shifted bands (Figure 6A). The specificity of the bands was confirmed by competition assay with addition of \u00d710 and \u00d7100 unlabeled wild-type NF-\u03baB oligonucleotides (oligos), while the mutant NF-\u03baB oligos did not have any significant effect on the shifted bands (Figure 6B). Consistent with the in vitro experiment, APP23/PS45 mice receiving ARA treatment showed a significant reduction in NF-\u03baB levels to 62.9% \u00b1 6.9% of those in the sham-injected controls (P < 0.005) (Figure 6, C and D). Thus, inhibition of GSK3 signaling attenuates NF-\u03baB binding to cis-acting p65 binding elements by reducing NF-\u03baB levels in the AD transgenic model mice in vivo. ARA reduced NF-\u03baB binding in APP23/PS45 mouse brains.Figure 6ARA reduced NF-\u03baB binding in APP23/PS45 mouse brains. APP23/PS45 mice were injected daily with ARA for 4 weeks, and whole brain lysates were subjected to EMSA. (A) Mice that received ARA had reduced intensity of NF-\u03baB shifted band. n = 3. (B) Whole brain lysates subjected to EMSA was competed with 10- and 100-fold excess of the wild-type and mutant NF-\u03baB oligos to demonstrate the specificity of binding.

Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 25 total; *P < 0.005. GSK3 inhibition reduces neuritic plaque formation in the AD model mice. To examine the specific effect of GSK3 signaling on AD pathogenesis, we treated APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice with ARA. The double transgenic mice develop detectable neuritic plaques in the neocortex and hippocampus as early as 1 month of age. The mice were treated with 5 mg/kg ARA at 6 weeks of age daily for 4 weeks, while age-matched control mice received vehicle solution. 4G8 immunostaining and thioflavin-S staining were used to detect A\u03b2-containing neuritic plaques in the brains (ref. 63 and Figure 7). ARA treatment significantly decreased the number of neuritic plaques in the transgenic mice relative to the vehicle-injected group (Figure 7, A and B). Quantification showed that overall ARA treatment reduced plaque number by approximately 50% (23.8 \u00b1 4.7 vs. 10.4 \u00b1 1.3 per slice, P < 0.01) (Figure 7C). Thioflavin-S staining also confirmed that ARA treatment dramatically reduced the number of A\u03b2-containing neuritic plaques in the brains of APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice (Figure 7, D and E). The inhibitory effect of ARA was reversible, and the treated mice (Figure 7G) had plaque numbers similar to those in the control mice (Figure 7F) when examined 3 months after the end of the drug treatment (36.5 \u00b1 5.1 vs. 32.1 \u00b1 4.2, P > 0.05) (Figure 7H). During the 4-week injection period, ARA treatment of the mice did not affect food consumption, and no significant weight changes were observed between the treatment and control groups (data not shown). AR-A014418 treatment significantly reduces neuritic plaque formation in ADFigure 7AR-A014418 treatment significantly reduces neuritic plaque formation in AD transgenic mice. (A and B) APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice at the age of 6 weeks were treated with ARA (5 mg/kg) for 4 weeks, while age-matched control APP23/PS45 mice received vehicle solution. The mice were sacrificed after behavioral tests, and the brains were dissected, fixed, and sectioned. Neuritic plaques were detected using A\u03b2 specific monoclonal antibody 4G8 (Signet). The plaques were visualized by microscopy with \u00d740 magnification.

Inhibition of GSK3 significantly improves memory deficits in the AD model mice. To investigate whether GSK3 inhibition by ARA treatment affects the memory deficit in AD pathogenesis, we used the Morris water maze to test spatial memory after APP23/PS45 mice received 1 month of ARA treatment (64). In the visible platform tests, ARA-treated and control APP23/PS45 mice had similar escape latency (42.4 \u00b1 4.3 and 44.8 \u00b1 2.7 seconds, P > 0.05) (Figure 8A) and path length (6.6 \u00b1 0.7 m and 6.1 \u00b1 0.5 m, P > 0.05) (Figure 8B), indicating that ARA treatment did not affect mouse mobility or vision. In the hidden platform test, ARA-treated mice showed significant improvements as compared with the vehicle-treated controls. The escape latency on the third and fourth days of the hidden platform test was shorter (12.0 \u00b1 1.6 and 17.4 \u00b1 3.1 seconds) than that of sham-treated mice (23.8 \u00b1 4.0 s and 24.9 \u00b1 2.7 s) (P < 0.05, Figure 8C). The ARA-treated mice swam significantly shorter distances to reach the platform (2.9 \u00b1 0.7 m and 3.2 \u00b1 0.3 m) as compared with control mice (3.7 \u00b1 0.6 and 4.2 \u00b1 0.5 m) on the third and fourth days (P < 0.05, Figure 8D). In the probe trial on the last day of testing, the platform was removed. ARA treatment significantly improved the spatial memory in the APP23/PS45 mice, as these mice spent more time searching for the platform in the appropriate quadrant (Supplemental Figure 3A). The number of times the mice traveled into the third quadrant, where the hidden platform was previously placed, was significantly greater with ARA treatment as compared with control (6.0 \u00b1 1.0 and 2.0 \u00b1 1.2 times, P < 0.05) (Figure 8E). Moreover, ARA-treated mice spent nearly twice as long in the southwest (SW) quadrant, where the platform was originally placed during the hidden platform test (NE 16.3.9% \u00b1 1.3%, SE 19.2% \u00b1 1.6%, SW 44.0% \u00b1 3.1%, NW 20.4% \u00b1 2.0%). The sham-treated mice, however, spent approximately equal amounts of time in each quadrant (NE 24.9% \u00b1 1.9%, SE 20.4% \u00b1 2.0%, SW 28.2% \u00b1 1.7%, NW 26.6% \u00b1 2.1%) (Supplemental Figure 3B). These data demonstrate that inhibition of GSK3 signaling significantly improved the memory deficits seen in the AD model mice. ARA improves memory deficits in AD transgenic mice.Figure 8ARA improves memory deficits in AD transgenic mice.

Animal movement was tracked and recorded by ANY-maze tracking software.

GSK3 is involved in tau hyperphosphorylation (65), neuronal apoptosis (66), and synaptic dysfunction (67). Moreover, GSK3 signaling has also been implicated in A\u03b2 production and neuritic plaque formation (51, 54, 68). However, the mechanism by which GSK3 affects APP processing and A\u03b2 production has not been clearly elucidated, and its pharmaceutical potential as an effective drug target remains to be validated. The current study clearly indicates that GSK3\u03b2, but not the related GSK3\u03b1 isoform, facilitates A\u03b2 production by upregulating BACE1 gene expression via NF-\u03baB p65 cis-acting elements on the BACE1 gene promoter. The C-terminal end of BACE1 undergoes phosphorylation, which regulates BACE1 trafficking and cellular levels (69, 70). In our study, inhibition of GSK3 signaling did not affect the phosphorylation status of BACE1 (data not shown). Thus, specifically inhibiting GSK3 decreases BACE1 expression and markedly reduces \u03b2-secretase processing of APP and A\u03b2 production, resulting in inhibition of neuritic plaque formation and amelioration of memory deficits in AD model mice. GSK3 appears to be a common molecular link between amyloidogenesis and tau abnormalities in AD pathology. Therefore, GSK3 inhibition has been proposed to be a valid therapeutic target for treating AD. Lithium chloride and valproic acid are known to have some inhibitory effects on GSK3 (71, 72) and have been used in the clinic for many decades for the treatment of bipolar disorders and epilepsy. Recent work has demonstrated that lithium and valproic acid could reduce A\u03b2 levels and improve cognitive performance in mouse models of AD (54, 68). While the inhibitory effects of lithium and valproic acid on GSK3 are known, both compounds have also been found to affect signaling cascades independent of GSK3. To further investigate the role of GSK3 on APP processing, we administered ARA, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of GSK3 (IC50 = 104 \u00b1 27 nM) (73) to APP Swedish stable cell lines and APP23/PS45 mice. We found that with specific GSK3 inhibition, the BACE1 major product C99 is reduced, accompanied by a significant reduction in A\u03b2 levels. Previous reports indicated that ARA treatment reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and tangle formation in transgenic mice overexpressing human tau, a model of AD (62). Our study shows that ARA also reduces plaque pathology and rescues cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model. However, continuous ARA treatment is required in order to reduce plaque pathology, as APP23/PS45 mice sacrificed 3 months after the last injection had plaque levels similar to those in the control group. Previous work by Phiel et al. (51) demonstrated that inhibition of GSK3\u03b1 with isoform-specific siRNA decreases \u03b3-secretase activity but found no effect of GSK3\u03b2. In our study, we found that in a system in which \u03b3-secretase activity is pharmacologically inhibited, GSK3\u03b1 knockdown did not have any significant effect on APP processing. On the other hand, GSK3\u03b2 knockdown with inhibition of \u03b3-secretase activity reduced the level of C99 fragment, indicating that BACE1 activity is affected. We further provided evidence that knocking down GSK3\u03b2 reduced BACE1 mRNA levels, but knocking down GSK3\u03b1 did not affect BACE1 expression. Previous genetic studies have found that during development GSK3\u03b1 could not compensate for the loss of GSK3\u03b2, as Gsk3b-KO mice are embryonic lethal while Gsk3a-KO mice are viable (61). This argues that GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 isoforms may have distinct cellular functions with respect to BACE1 expression. Moreover, GSK3\u03b2 is the predominant isoform in the brain and therefore has been implicated in many CNS disorders (74). However, Jaworski et al. recently showed the GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 knockout mice did not show any changes to APP processing and A\u03b2 production (52). This could be due to a physiological compensation of BACE1 expression in the KO mice compared with the acute effect of the GSK3 inhibitor. Additionally, our data showed that GSK3\u03b2 regulated NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated BACE1 expression. Gsk3a knockout had no effect on NF-\u03baB signaling. Taken together, these studies suggest that GSK3 isoforms have distinct roles in regulating APP processing. We do not believe that gene silencing of GSK3 isoforms would be a valid approach for treating AD. Complete ablation of each isoform may lead to compensatory elevated activity of the other isoform or even other functionally protein kinases. Moreover, it has been reported that complete ablation of GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 expression in mice results in various abnormalities (75), which may interfere with any therapeutic values. Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested a significant inflammatory component in AD (76\u201379). However, it remains controversial whether neuroinflammation is a driving force for AD or simply a byproduct of the disease (80). Moreover, the detrimental role of astrocyte and microglia during neuroinflammation remains elusive. The release of various proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines has been shown to affect APP processing, A\u03b2 production, and neurodegenerative changes in AD brains. There have been preclinical studies to show that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or anti-inflammatory cytokines have beneficial effects in treating AD (80, 81). However, there are reports demonstrating that anti-inflammatory stimuli could potentiate A\u03b2 production, possibly through suppression of glia-mediated A\u03b2 clearance. On the other hand, proinflammatory stimuli could also have extreme effects on AD pathogenesis. There is a large amount of evidence to show that increased proinflammatory cytokines correlates with A\u03b2 production and neurodegeneration. In contrast, there are also a number of studies indicating that proinflammatory cytokines precondition the system for A\u03b2 challenge and protect against neurodegeneration (82\u201385). Clearly, inflammation is a major component of the AD brain, and more work will be required in order to elucidate its role in AD pathogenesis. Since several proinflammatory cytokines including the interleukins and TNF have been found to activate GSK3\u03b2, and GSK3 inhibitors showed anti-inflammatory effects (86\u201388), we speculate that GSK3 plays an important role in the inflammatory response driving A\u03b2 production. The chronic inflammatory response induced by A\u03b2 may depend on transcription factors to exert neurodegenerative effects. Regulation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and its transcriptional activity may in part play a role in A\u03b2-mediated neurodegeneration (27, 89). It has been previously reported that the BACE1 promoter contains NF-\u03baB\u2013binding elements (27, 90) and exacerbated A\u03b2 levels modulate the BACE1 promoter activity via NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent pathways (91). More recently, Chen et al. (27) found increased NF-\u03baB p65 and BACE1 expression in postmortem AD brains. Furthermore, overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 was found to increase human BACE1 promoter activity, whereas inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling reduced BACE1 expression (27). Exogenous application of A\u03b2 has been found to increase GSK3\u03b2 activity and NF-\u03baB levels. There are many reports suggesting that GSK3\u03b2 regulates gene transcription in an NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent manner (61, 92, 93). Therefore, we argue that the GSK3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is involved in regulating BACE1 gene transcription. In this study, we found that interfering with GSK3\u03b2 activity using Gsk3b-KO cells or ARA treatment reduced BACE1 promoter activity and gene expression. Moreover, disrupting NF-\u03baB expression also blocked GSK3\u03b2-induced BACE1 transcription. Long-term treatment with GSK3 inhibitors always raises the concern about unwanted side effects. Many of the Wnt signal transduction components such as the APC gene or \u03b2-catenin gene carry mutations that render the protein nondegradable (94). Prolonged activation of the Wnt pathway has been linked to development of various cancers (95). GSK3 inhibitors including SB216763, SB415286, Kenpaullone, and lithium chloride have all been shown to elevate the level of \u03b2-catenin (51, 96, 97). Consequently, it may be possible that GSK3 inhibitors may mimic Wnt signaling and could potentially be oncogenic. However, long-term use of lithium chloride to treat bipolar disorder has not been linked to increased risk of cancer. Interestingly, administration of the GSK3 inhibitors CHIR99021 and ARA did not change \u03b2-catenin levels (65). Moreover, \u03b2-catenin levels are largely unaffected in Gsk3b-KO embryos (61). These findings indicate that the inhibition of GSK3 by itself might not be sufficient to elevate the level of \u03b2-catenin. It is possible that there are specific pools of GSK3 that are insensitive to certain GSK3 inhibitors, thereby sparing the effect of increasing \u03b2-catenin levels. In order to validate the therapeutic efficacy of GSK3 inhibition, while minimizing oncogenic side effects, long-term treatment studies in cells and animals will be required. In conclusion, we have found that the GSK3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway regulates BACE1 transcription and thereby facilitates A\u03b2 production in AD. Since GSK3\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB are involved in AD pathogenesis, our results suggest that direct interference of this pathway may be a promising drug target for AD therapy.

The following primers were used to specifically amplify BACE1, GSK3A, GSK3B, APP, and PS1 genes: BACE1 forward 5\u2032-cccgcagacgctcaacatcc and reverse 5\u2032-GCCACTGTCCACAATGCTCTT; GSK3A forward 5\u2032-TGAAGCTGGGCCGTGACAGCGG and reverse 5\u2032-ACATGTACACCTTGACATAG; GSK3B forward 5\u2032-TCAGGAGTGCGGGTCTTCCGAC and reverse 5\u2032-CTCCAGTATTAGCATCTGACGCT; APP forward 5\u2032-GCTGGCCTGCTGGCTGAACC and reverse 5\u2032-GGCGACGGTGTGCCAGTGAA; PS1 forward 5\u2032-GAGACACAGGACAGTGGTTCTGG and reverse 5\u2032-GGCCGATCAGTATGGCTACAAA. \u03b2-Actin was used as an internal control. The samples were resolved and analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel. Immunoblot analysis. Brain tissues or cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 4% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) supplemented with 200 mM sodium orthovanadate, 25 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM PMSF, and a complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche Diagnostics). The samples were diluted in 4\u00d7 SDS-sample buffer, boiled, and resolved on 12% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE or 16% Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvindylidine fluoride (PVDF-FL) membranes. For immunoblot analysis, membranes were blocked for 1 hour in PBS containing 5% nonfat dried milk, followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C in primary antibodies diluted in the blocking medium. Rabbit anti-APP C-terminal polyclonal antibody C20 was used to detect APP and its CTF products. PS1 was detected by anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody 231. Total GSK3\u03b2 was determined using a pan-specific mouse anti-GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 antibody (BioSource International Inc.). Total \u03b2-catenin was determined using a pan-specific rabbit anti\u2013\u03b2-catenin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). The NF-\u03baB p65 subunit was determined using mouse anti-p65 (Sigma-Aldrich). Internal control \u03b2-actin was analyzed using monoclonal antibody AC-15 (Sigma-Aldrich). BACE1 was detected with the anti-BACE1 antibody 208 recognizing the C-terminal end (101). A\u03b240/42 ELISA. HEK293 cells stably expressing the human APP gene containing the Swedish mutation were maintained in cell culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS. Following ARA treatment for 24 hours, conditioned medium was harvested, and protease inhibitors and AEBSF (Roche Diagnostics) were added to prevent degradation of A\u03b2 peptides. APP23/PS45 double transgenic mouse cortical tissues were prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions prior to carrying out the ELISA protocol (Invitrogen). The concentration of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 were detected using an A\u03b21\u201340 or A\u03b21\u201342 Colorimetric ELISA kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. EMSA. Whole brain extracts were prepared by homogenizing the tissue in Buffer C (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitor. EMSA was performed as previously described with a few changes (102). Briefly, 20\u201340 \u03bcg protein was incubated with an IRDye 700\u2013labeled NF-\u03baB oligo (5\u2032-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC), and the gels were scanned using the Odyssey system (LI-COR Biosciences). In the competition assay, unlabeled wild-type and mutant (5\u2032-AGTTGAGGCCACTTTCCCAGGC) NF-\u03baB oligos at \u00d710 and \u00d7100 molar excess were used to compete for binding. Transgenic mice and drug treatment. APP23 mice overexpressing the Swedish APP751 (KM\u2192NL) mutant transgene driven by the mouse Thy1.2 promoter were originally generated at Novartis Pharma as previously described (30, 103). APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice were generated by crossing APP23 mice with mice overexpressing the human G384A-mutated PS1 under the control of the murine Thy1 promoter (B6,D2-TgN(Thy1-PS1G384A)45) (54, 103\u2013105). APP23 and PS45 mice had been backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice for more than 7 generations prior to breeding for the double transgenic mice. The genotype of the mice was confirmed by PCR using DNA from tail tissues. The treatment group contained 14 animals (8 females, 6 males), and the sham-injected group contained 12 animals (7 females, 5 males). The treatment group received 5 mg/kg ARA diluted in 0.9% saline daily via intraperitoneal injection at the same time each day. Mice in the control group were injected with the vehicle solution containing DMSO diluted in 0.9% saline only. We tabulated the daily food consumption and weight for each mouse. Immunohistochemical staining. Mice were sacrificed after behavioral testing, and half brains were immediately homogenized for protein, RNA, or DNA extraction. The other halves of the brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned with a Leica Cryostat to 30-\u03bcm thickness. Every twelfth slice with the same reference position was mounted onto slides for staining. Immunocytochemical staining was performed on floating sections. The plaques in the sections were detected with biotinylated monoclonal 4G8 antibody (Signetlabs) in 1:500 dilution, visualized by the ABC and DAB method, and counted under a \u00d740 objective as previously described (54, 63). Plaques were quantified, and the average plaque count per slice was recorded for each mouse. Thioflavin-S staining of plaques was performed with 1% thioflavin-S visualized using fluorescence microscopy (54). Morris water maze test. The Morris water maze test was performed as previously described (30, 64). The APP23/PS45 mice treated with or without ARA were subjected to the Morris water maze test 1 day after the last injection regimen. The test was performed in a 1.5-meter-diameter pool with a 10-cm-diameter platform placed in the SE quadrant of the pool. The procedure consisted of 1 day of visible platform tests and 4 days of hidden platform tests, plus a probe trial 24 hours after the last hidden platform test. In the visible platform test performed on the first day, the mice were tested for 5 continuous trials, with an inter-trial interval of 60 minutes. In the hidden platform tests, mice were trained for 5 trials, with an inter-trial interval of 1 hour. Each mouse was allowed 60 seconds to search for the platform. In the scenario where the mouse could not locate the platform, the experiment guided it to the platform and allowed the mouse to rest there for 15 seconds. On the last day of the test, each mouse was subjected to the probe trial in which the platform was removed. Each mouse was given 60 seconds to locate where the platform was originally placed. Mouse behavior including distance traveled, escape latency and the number of passes through the platform was recorded by automated video tracking (ANY-maze, Stoelting). The data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. Statistics. All results were presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and analyzed by ANOVA or 2-tailed Student\u2019s t-test. Statistical significance is accepted when P < 0.05. Study approval. Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the University of British Columbia Animal Care and Use Committee and Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) guidelines.Supplemental dataView Supplemental dataAcknowledgmentsWe thank Steven R.

First published December 3, 2012Received for publication April 26, 2012, and accepted in revised form September 27, 2012.Deposition of amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) to form neuritic plaques in the brain is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). A\u03b2 is generated from sequential cleavages of the \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases, and \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the \u03b2-secretase essential for A\u03b2 generation. Previous studies have indicated that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) may play a role in APP processing by modulating \u03b3-secretase activity, thereby facilitating A\u03b2 production. There are two highly conserved isoforms of GSK3: GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2. We now report that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production by decreasing BACE1 gene transcription and expression. The regulation of BACE1 gene expression by GSK3\u03b2 was dependent on NF-\u03baB signaling. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling markedly reduced A\u03b2 deposition and neuritic plaque formation, and rescued memory deficits in the double transgenic AD model mice. These data provide evidence for regulation of BACE1 expression and AD pathogenesis by GSK3\u03b2 and that inhibition of GSK3 signaling can reduce A\u03b2 neuropathology and alleviate memory deficits in AD model mice. Our study suggests that interventions that specifically target the \u03b2-isoform of GSK3 may be a safe and effective approach for treating AD. IntroductionAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia. The characteristic neuropathological features of AD include neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Amyloid \u03b2 protein (A\u03b2), the central component of neuritic plaques, is produced from sequential endoproteolytic cleavages of the type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase. Proteolytic processing of APP at the \u03b2 site is essential for generating A\u03b2, and \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the \u03b2-secretase in vivo (1\u20134). BACE1 cleaves APP at two \u03b2-sites, Asp+1 and Glu+11 of the A\u03b2 domain, to generate C99 and C89 fragment, respectively (5). Subsequently, \u03b3-secretase cleaves C99 within its transmembrane domain to release A\u03b2 and APP C-terminal fragment \u03b3 (CTF\u03b3). In addition to APP, BACE1 substrates also include other proteins: LRP (6), APLP1 (7), APLP2 (8), ST6Gal I (9), and PSGL-1 (10). BACE1 expression is tightly regulated at the level of transcription (5, 11, 12) and translation (13\u201316). It was reported that a G/C polymorphism in exon 5 of the BACE1 gene might be associated with some sporadic cases of AD (17\u201319). Although genetic analyses from our and other laboratories have failed to uncover any mutation in the BACE1 coding sequence or any disease-associated SNP in its promoter region in AD patients (20\u201322), increased \u03b2-secretase levels and activity have been reported in AD (23\u201327). BACE1 levels were elevated in neurons around plaques (28). BACE1 mRNA levels tended to increase as miR-107 levels decreased in the progression of AD (29). We reported that hypoxia, a common vascular component among AD risk factors, increased BACE1 expression, resulting in both increased A\u03b2 deposition and memory deficits in AD transgenic mice (30). Recently we found that both NF-\u03baB and BACE1 levels were increased in sporadic AD patients, and NF-\u03baB facilitated BACE1 gene expression and APP processing (27). Thus, increased BACE1 expression by NF-\u03baB signaling in the brain could be one of the mechanisms underlying AD development (27). Together, these studies indicate that BACE1 dysregulation plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. BACE1 has been considered as one of the major targets for AD drug development. Bace1-knockout mice have abolished A\u03b2 generation (31\u201333). Suppression of BACE1 by RNA interference reduced APP processing and A\u03b2 production in primary cortical neurons derived from both wild-type and Swedish APP mutant transgenic mice (34), and disruption of the Bace1 gene rescued memory deficits and cholinergic dysfunction in Swedish APP mice (35). Oral administration of a potent and selective BACE1 inhibitor decreased \u03b2-cleavage and A\u03b2 production in APP transgenic mice in vivo (36). Bace1-KO mice were reported to display hypomyelination of peripheral nerves and aberrant axonal segregation (37, 38), suggesting that inhibiting \u03b2-secretase may have unwanted collateral effects. However, even a partial reduction in BACE1 can have dramatically beneficial effects on AD pathology (39), suggesting that therapeutic inhibition of BACE1 is a valid therapeutic target for AD treatment. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinase originally identified as playing an important role in glycogen metabolism. Since its discovery, many studies have shown that GSK3 has pleiotropic functions, including embryonic development, gene transcription, and neuronal cell function (40). In mammals, two GSK3 isoforms are encoded by distinct genes: GSK3A produces a 51-kDa GSK3\u03b1 protein and GSK3B a 47-kDa GSK3\u03b2 protein (41). These two isoforms are highly homologous, sharing greater than 95% amino acid identity in the catalytic domains. Although both isoforms are ubiquitously expressed, the \u03b2 isoform is expressed at higher levels in neuronal tissues (42). GSK3 activity is regulated at several levels. Phosphorylation of Tyr279/Tyr216 on GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 is important for enzymatic activity (43). Inactivation of GSK3 can be achieved through phosphorylation of Ser21/Ser9 residues within the N-terminal domain on GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2, respectively. Stimulation of tissues by insulin and growth factors activates the PI3K/PKB/Akt signal transduction cascade, leading to phosphorylation of these inhibitory serine residues (44, 45). GSK3 is also regulated upon interaction of the Wnt ligand and its receptor Frizzled and co-receptor LRP5/6. This interaction releases GSK3 from a multi-protein complex formed by \u03b2-catenin, axin, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (46, 47), which prevents GSK3-mediated \u03b2-catenin degradation and induces \u03b2-catenin\u2013dependent gene transcription. Dysregulation of GSK3 activity has been implicated in AD. Increased GSK3\u03b2 activity was found in postmortem AD brains (48). GSK3\u03b2 has been found to phosphorylate the tau protein on various conserved sites and contribute to tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation (49, 50). GSK3\u03b1 was reported to regulate A\u03b2 production by positively modulating the \u03b3-secretase complex (51), although this finding has recently been challenged (52). Inhibition of GSK3 activity with the commonly known GSK3 inhibitors LiCl and valproic acid in cell culture (53) and animal models of AD decreased A\u03b2 production (51, 54). Although LiCl and valproic acid are known to inhibit GSK3 activity, these compounds also activate a plethora of signaling cascades that could differentially regulate APP processing independent of GSK3 (55\u201358). In this study, we examined the effects of GSK3\u03b2-specific inhibition on AD neuropathology and behavioral deficits and identified its underlying mechanism. We found that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP. Treatment with the GSK3 inhibitor AR-A014418 (ARA) reduced neuritic plaque formation and alleviated memory deficits in AD transgenic model mice. Furthermore, we found that GSK3\u03b2 regulated BACE1 transcription via NF-\u03baB signaling. Our work provides evidence that specific inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 may be an effective therapeutic approach for treating AD. ResultsRegulation of \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production by GSK3 signaling. Previous studies showed that LiCl and valproic acid modulated GSK3 signaling and reduced A\u03b2 production (51, 54). However, the underlying mechanism is not well defined, and these compounds also have many confounding GSK3-independent effects. To examine the specific effect of GSK3 signaling on APP processing, we applied ARA, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of GSK3, to 20E2 cells, a stable cell line expressing human Swedish mutant APP (5). ARA at 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM significantly decreased the levels of the \u03b2-secretase cleavage product APP C99 to 95.7% \u00b1 1.6%, 66.4% \u00b1 0.7%, and 31.3% \u00b1 0.4%, respectively (P < 0.001 by 1-way ANOVA) (Figure 1A and B). The treatment had no significant effect on APP expression (Figure 1A). The A\u03b2 ELISA was performed to assess the levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 in the conditioned media of 20E2 cells. ARA markedly reduced A\u03b2 generation in a dose-dependent manner. A\u03b240 was decreased to 99.2% \u00b1 3.8%, 73.2% \u00b1 4.6%, and 48.7% \u00b1 1.3% with 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM of ARA treatment, respectively (P < 0.05) (Figure 1C); and A\u03b242 was reduced to 99.2% \u00b1 3.1%, 73.2% \u00b1 3.5%, and 48.7% \u00b1 4.5% with 1, 2.5 and 5 \u03bcM of ARA treatment, respectively (P < 0.01 by 1-way ANOVA) (Figure 1D). As expected, inhibition of GSK3 stabilized \u03b2-catenin (Figure 1A), and ARA treatment resulted in a significant increase in \u03b2-catenin levels to 152.7% \u00b1 11.1%, 221.3% \u00b1 17.0%, and 233.7% \u00b1 25.0% with 1, 2.5, and 5 \u03bcM, respectively (P < 0.05). These data indicate that specifically inhibiting GSK3 reduced BACE1-mediated APP processing and C99 and A\u03b2 production. Specific inhibition of GSK3 reduces BACE1 cleavage of APP.Figure 1Specific inhibition of GSK3 reduces BACE1 cleavage of APP. (A) Swedish mutant APP stable cell line 20E2 was cultured and treated with ARA for 24 hours, and cell lysates subjected to Western blot analysis. Full-length APP and the APP CTFs were detected with C20 antibody. \u03b2-Catenin was detected by anti\u2013\u03b2-catenin antibody. \u03b2-Actin was detected by anti-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control. (B) Quantification of APP C99 generation in 20E2 cells. ARA treatment significantly increased \u03b2-catenin levels in a dose-dependent manner, while APP C99 production decreased with increasing ARA dosage. n = 6; *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, ANOVA. A\u03b2 ELISA detection of A\u03b240 (C) and A\u03b242 (D) in conditioned medium from 20E2 cells treated with ARA for 24 hours. ARA treatment reduced A\u03b2 levels in the conditioned medium in a dose-dependent manner. The values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, ANOVA. (E) \u03b3-Secretase activity in 20E2 cells was inhibited by the pharmacological inhibitor L685,458 (GSI). Co-treatment with specific GSK3 inhibitors ARA and G2 reduced C99. Con, control. (F) Quantification of C99 levels. n = 6; *P < 0.05, ANOVA. To further examine the effect of GSK3 on \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production, we pharmacologically blocked \u03b3-secretase activity with the \u03b3-secretase\u2013specific inhibitor L658,458 in 20E2 cells while co-treating with the GSK3 inhibitor ARA and G2. G2 is another structurally distinct GSK3 inhibitor, with an IC50 of 304 nM (59). As expected, \u03b3-secretase inhibition resulted in markedly increased generation of the APP CTFs C83 and C99 (Figure 1E). Addition of ARA or G2 reduced C99 levels to 78.2% \u00b1 1.1% and 63.9% \u00b1 6.6% (Figure 1, E and F). ARA treatment had no significant effect on Notch cleavage (Supplemental Figure 1B; supplemental material available online with this article; doi: 10.1172/JCI64516DS1). These data demonstrated that specific inhibition of GSK3 reduced \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP to generate C99 and A\u03b2 production in cells. GSK3\u03b2 but not GSK3\u03b1 regulates BACE1 gene expression and BACE1-mediated APP processing. Our study has shown that GSK3 regulated \u03b2-secretase processing of APP, an essential step for A\u03b2 generation. Since BACE1 is the \u03b2-secretase in vivo, we first examined whether GSK3 affects BACE1 gene expression. GSK3 has two highly homologous isoforms, GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2. We used RNA interference to specifically knock down the expression of GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 isoforms in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to determine whether both isoforms or one of the isoforms play a major role in regulating BACE1 gene expression. Specific knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 expression by the siRNA significantly reduced BACE1 mRNA levels to 76.0% \u00b1 6.6% as compared with control (P < 0.05) (Figure 2, A and B), whereas knockdown of GSK3\u03b1 did not affect BACE1 mRNA expression (P > 0.05) (Figure 2, A and B). Additional exogenous expression of GSK3\u03b2 rescued the reduction of BACE1 expression resulting from knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 by siRNA (Supplemental Figure 2). To examine whether specific knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 expression also affected \u03b2-secretase processing of APP, we transfected siRNA specific to GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 into 20E2 cells while inhibiting \u03b3-secretase activity with L658,458. Western blotting showed that GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 siRNA specifically reduced GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 expression, respectively (Figure 2C). Knockdown of GSK3\u03b1 expression did not significantly affect BACE1-mediated APP processing, whereas GSK3\u03b2 knockdown reduced the production of the BACE1 cleavage product C99 to 51.9% \u00b1 6.4% (P < 0.05) (Figure 2, C and D). GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, regulates BACE1 gene expression and APP processing.Figure 2GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, regulates BACE1 gene expression and APP processing. (A) SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were transfected with scrambled GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2 isoform\u2013specific siRNA. RNA was extracted, and semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed to measure endogenous human BACE1, GSK3A, GSK3B, and \u03b2-actin mRNA levels with specific primers recognizing the coding sequence of each gene. PCR products after 28 cycles were analyzed on 1.2% agarose gel. (B) Endogenous BACE1 mRNA was significantly reduced with GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, isoform\u2013specific knockdown. The values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 3; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. (C) 20E2 cells were transfected with scrambled or GSK3\u03b1, or GSK3\u03b2 isoform\u2013specific siRNA while cotreated with L685,458 to block \u03b3-secretase activity. Full-length APP and CTF fragments were detected with C20 antibody. GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 were detected using a monoclonal GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 antibody. GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 isoforms were selectively reduced by the isoform-specific siRNA. \u03b2-Actin served as an internal control and was detected using a monoclonal anti\u2013\u03b2-actin antibody, AC-15. (D) GSK3\u03b2-specific knockdown significantly reduced C99 levels. GSK3\u03b1-specific knockdown did not have any significant effect. The values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. (E) Tetracycline-regulated SHSY5Y cells were induced to express constitutively active S9A-GSK3\u03b2. Endogenous human BACE1 mRNA levels were assessed as described above. Tetracyline-induced S9A-GSK3\u03b2 significantly increased BACE1 expression. (F) Quantification of the endogenous BACE1 mRNA level. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test. To further confirm that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene expression at the transcription level, we assayed BACE1 mRNA in the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 inducible SHSY5Y stable cell line. This stable cell line carries the constitutively active mutant GSK3\u03b2, and expression of the mutant gene is under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (60). Addition of tetracycline induced the expression of active GSK3\u03b2 (Figure 2E) and resulted in significantly increased expression of BACE1 to 251.1% \u00b1 70.0% relative to the control (P < 0.05) (Figure 2F). These data demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2, but not GSK3\u03b1, specifically regulates BACE1 gene expression and contribute to APP processing. GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene promoter activity. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 gene expression at the transcription level, we performed a BACE1 gene promoter assay. Two human BACE1 gene promoter deletion plasmids were constructed. Regions of the BACE1 promoter from \u20132890 to +292 bp (pB1-A) and from \u20139 to +292 bp (pB1-B) were inserted into promoterless vector pGL3-basic upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Figure 3A). To examine the effect of GSK3 on BACE1 gene promoter activity, we transfected N2a cells with pB1-A and then treated them with ARA. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling by ARA significantly decreased the promoter activity of pB1-A in N2a cells to 54.9% \u00b1 6.2% (P < 0.005) (Figure 3B). To further investigate the underlying mechanism and determine the BACE1 promoter region that mediates the transcriptional activation by GSK3 signaling, we co-transfected N2a cells with either pB1-A or pB1-B plasmid together with the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 plasmid, which carries a constitutively active form of GSK3\u03b2. Expression of active GSK3\u03b2 markedly increased the luciferase activity of pB1-A in the S9A-GSK3\u03b2 transfected cells to 144.0% \u00b1 2.0% as compared with the control (P < 0.05), but had no significant effect on the luciferase activity of pB1-B (P > 0.05) (Figure 3C). This result showed that enhancing GSK3\u03b2 signaling upregulated BACE1 gene promoter activity and the 2.8-kb promoter region is responsible for GSK3\u03b2-mediated upregulation of BACE1 transcription. To further confirm this finding, we transfected these two deletion promoter plasmids into Gsk3b-KO or wild-type cells. Ablation of Gsk3b expression in the Gsk3b-KO cells resulted in significant reduction in luciferase activity of pB1-A to 47.0% \u00b1 7.5% as compared with the wild-type control cells (P < 0.01) (Figure 3D). However, knockout of the Gsk3b gene had no significant effect on the luciferase activity of pB1-B (Figure 3D). Taken together, these results demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene expression via its effect on the BACE1 promoter. GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 promoter activation.Figure 3GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 promoter activation. (A) Schematic of the 3.3-kb (pB1-A) and 300-bp (pB1-B) human BACE1 promoter/luciferase construct. (B) The 3.5-kb human BACE1 promoter was transfected into N2a cells and treated with 5 \u03bcM ARA. GSK3 inhibition with ARA treatment resulted in a significant decrease in luciferase activity. (C) N2a cells were co-transfected with either promoter constructs and S9A-GSK3\u03b2 or a vector control. S9A-GSK3\u03b2 significantly increased the luciferase activity of the 3.3-kb BACE1 promoter construct but did not have any effect on the 300-bp promoter construct. (D) pB1-A or pB1-B constructs were transfected into Gsk3b-KO MEFs. pB1-A had significantly reduced promoter activity. All promoter data shown represent an average of at least 4 independent experiments, with each condition performed in triplicate. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005, Student\u2019s t test. NF-\u03baB mediates the transcriptional regulation of BACE1 gene expression by GSK3\u03b2. Recently we reported that levels of both BACE1 and NF-\u03baB are increased in AD brains, and NF-\u03baB signaling upregulates human BACE1 gene expression by acting on the cis-acting p65-binding element in its promoter (27). Previous studies in Gsk3b-KO mice demonstrated that GSK3\u03b2 is required for proper activation of NF-\u03baB (61). As our data indicate that GSK3\u03b2 regulates BACE1 gene transcription, we next examined whether regulation of BACE1 transcription by GSK3\u03b2 signaling is dependent on NF-\u03baB. TNF-\u03b1 is a strong activator of NF-\u03baB p65 expression. In order to examine the specific role of NF-\u03baB in GSK3\u03b2-regulated BACE1 transcription, we transfected N2a cells with a pBACE1-4\u03baB promoter plasmid that contained only the NF-\u03baB\u2013binding elements in the human BACE1 promoter (27). After transfection, the cells were cotreated with TNF-\u03b1 and the GSK3 inhibitor ARA. ARA treatment alone consistently reduced BACE1 promoter activity (Figure 4A). TNF-\u03b1 stimulation increased pB1A promoter activity to 132.6% \u00b1 7.5% of the control (P < 0.01). However, ARA treatment reduced the TNF-\u03b1\u2013induced BACE1 promoter activation to 115.6 \u00b1 6.9% as compared with TNF-\u03b1 treatment alone (P < 0.05) (Figure 4A). Overexpression of p65 NF-\u03baB significantly increased the BACE1 promoter activity to 487.1% \u00b1 102.2% as compared with the control (P < 0.001) (Figure 3D). However, ARA did not affect NF-\u03baB p65\u2019s upregulating effect on BACE1 promoter activity (P > 0.05), indicating that GSK3 signaling may have its effect upstream of NF-\u03baB in the modulation of BACE1 transcription (Figure 4B). To further confirm ARA\u2019s effect on NF-\u03baB activity, we co-transfected N2a cells with pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc and NF-\u03baB p65 or an empty vector, followed by treatment with ARA to inhibit GSK3 signaling. ARA reduced pNF-\u03baB-Luc promoter activity to 51.9% \u00b1 9.1% as compared with control (P < 0.05) (Figure 4C). Overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 significantly increased pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc promoter activity to 203.36 \u00b1 87.38\u2013fold (P < 0.001) (Figure 4C). Additional ARA treatment did not have any significant effect on the transcriptional activation of pNF-\u03baB\u2013Luc by NF-\u03baB p65 overexpression (P > 0.05) (Figure 4C). These data indicate that the p65-binding elements in the BACE1 promoter mediated the effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 transcription. GSK3\u03b2 regulation of BACE1 transcription is dependent on NF-\u03baB p65 expressioFigure 4GSK3\u03b2 regulation of BACE1 transcription is dependent on NF-\u03baB p65 expression. (A) pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB plasmid contains the 4 NF-\u03baB cis-elements from the human BACE1 promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. N2a cells were co-transfected with pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB and pCMV-RLuc. Transfected cells were treated with vehicle solution (control) or 10 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 with/without 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours. (B) N2a cells were co-transfected with pBACE1-4NF-\u03baB plasmid and pMTF-p65 or a vector control. Transfected cells were then treated with a vehicle solution or 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours. (C) pNF-\u03baB-Luc was co-transfected with pMTF-p65 or a vector control and treated with a vehicle solution or 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours. Renilla luciferase was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 4; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, Student\u2019s t test. (D) Wild-type MEFs and RelA-KO MEFs which are dysfunctional for NF-\u03baB activity, were co-transfected with a 3.5-kb human BACE1 promoter and S9A-GSK3\u03b2 or a control vector. S9A-GSK3\u03b2 overexpression in MEFs. significantly increased luciferase activity (*P < 0.05, Student\u2019s t test), whereas RelA-KO MEFs did not have any significant effect. Luciferase activity is indicative of BACE1 promoter activity. All promoter data shown represent an average of at least 4 independent experiments, with each condition performed in triplicate. (E) N2a cells were treated with 5 \u03bcM ARA for 24 hours, followed by cell fractionation. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. ARA treatment significantly reduced NF-\u03baB p65 levels in the (F) nuclear fraction (n = 6; **P < 0.001, Student\u2019s t test) and (G) cytosolic fraction. n = 6; ***P < 0.001, Student\u2019s t test. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. To confirm the role of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in GSK3\u03b2-mediated BACE1 transcription, we transfected NF-\u03baB p65 knockout RelA-KO cells and wild-type control cells with the BACE1 promoter pB1-A and the constitutively active GSK3\u03b2 expression plasmid S9A-GSK3\u03b2. In wild-type cells, activation of GSK3\u03b2 signaling by expression of S9A-GSK3\u03b2 markedly increased BACE1 promoter activity to 189.6% \u00b1 20.9% as compared with the vector control (P < 0.05), whereas activation of GSK3\u03b2 signaling by expression of S9A-GSK3\u03b2 had no effect on BACE1 promoter activity in RelA-KO cells (P > 0.05) (Figure 4D), indicating that disruption of NF-\u03baB p65 expression in RelA-KO cells abolished GSK3\u03b2\u2019s effect on the transcriptional activation of the human BACE1 gene promoter. To further examine the effect of GSK3 inhibition on NF-\u03baB p65 expression, we treated N2a cells with ARA and subjected them to subcellular fractionation (Figure 4E). ARA treatment significantly reduced nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 levels to 46.9% \u00b1 9.1% as compared with control (P < 0.01) (Figure 4F). Moreover, ARA treatment also reduced cytosolic NF-\u03baB p65 levels to 56.1% \u00b1 7.1% as compared with control (P < 0.001) (Figure 4G). These data show that GSK3 inhibition with ARA reduced NF-\u03baB activity by decreasing NF-\u03baB p65 levels. Taken together, our results demonstrate that NF-\u03baB signaling mediates the regulatory effect of GSK3\u03b2 on BACE1 gene expression. GSK3 regulates BACE1 gene expression, APP processing, and A\u03b2 production in vivo. Our data provide strong evidence that GSK3\u03b2 activates BACE1 gene expression, resulting in enhanced \u03b2-secretase processing of APP and A\u03b2 production in vitro. To examine the effect of GSK3 signaling on BACE1 gene expression and APP processing in vivo, we first assayed APP CTFs and A\u03b2 production in the brain of APP23/PS45 mice by Western blot analysis (Figure 5, A and B). APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice, an AD mouse model, were generated by crossing APP23 mice, carrying the human Swedish mutant APP751 transgene driven by the neuron-specific Thy1.2 promoter, and PS45 mice, carrying the human familial AD\u2013associated G384A mutant presenilin-1 (PS1) (54). The mice were treated with 5 mg/kg of the GSK3 inhibitor ARA at 6 weeks of age daily for 4 weeks, while age-matched control mice received vehicle solution. ARA treatment significantly decreased the brain levels of the \u03b2-secretase\u2013generated CTF\u03b2 fragments C99 and C89, to 38.4% \u00b1 4.8% relative to controls (P < 0.05) (Figure 5B). The levels of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 were reduced to 71.2% \u00b1 8.3% and 65.6% \u00b1 11.0% in ARA-treated mice relative to controls, (P < 0.05) (Figure 5, C and D). These data demonstrate that inhibition of GSK3 activity by ARA treatment reduces \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo. ARA inhibits BACE1 cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo.Figure 5ARA inhibits BACE1 cleavage of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo. (A) Hemi-brains from ARA-treated and control APP23/PS45 mice of the 6 weeks age group were homogenized in RIPA-Doc lysis buffer and separated with 12% Tris-glycine or 16% Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE. Full-length APP and APP CTFs (C99 and C89) were detected by C20 polyclonal antibody. PS1 was detected by anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody 231. BACE1 was detected by anti-BACE1 antibody. \u03b2-Actin was detected by anti\u2013\u03b2-actin antibody AC-15 as the internal control. (B) Quantification showed that CTF\u03b2 was significantly decreased in ARA-treated mice. n = 25 mice total. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, Student\u2019s t test. ELISA was performed to measure A\u03b240 (C) and A\u03b242 (D) levels from the brain tissues of APP23/PS45 mice injected with or without ARA. n = 8 for each group; *P < 0.005, Student\u2019s t test. (E) Total RNA was isolated from APP23/PS45 mouse cortices by TRI Reagent. Sets of gene-specific primers were used to amplify Bace1 (E), PS1 (G), and App (I) genes. \u03b2-Actin was used as an internal control. Bace1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced (F), while there were no difference in endogenous PS1 (H) or App (J) mRNA levels between ARA-treated mice and controls. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 12 total; *P < 0.01, Student\u2019s t test. We then examined whether the level of BACE1 was altered by GSK3 signaling in vivo. Western blot analysis showed that inhibition of GSK3 signaling significantly reduced the protein level of BACE1 to 64.7% \u00b1 7.3% in ARA-treated mice, as compared with the control mice (P < 0.01), and the treatment had no significant effect on APP and PS1 protein levels (P > 0.05) (Figure 5, A and B). We further showed that GSK3 inhibition with ARA reduced tau phosphorylation, which is consistent with previous findings (ref. 62 and Supplemental Figure 1A). Our in vitro study has shown that GSK3\u03b2 regulates the transcription of the BACE1 gene. To confirm that the decrease in BACE1 protein level seen in the brains of the ARA-treated mice was due to reduced BACE1 gene transcription, the endogenous Bace1 mRNA levels were measured (Figure 5, E, G, and I). ARA treatment markedly reduced Bace1 mRNA level to 36.7% \u00b1 11.8% (P < 0.01) (Figure 5F), but did not significantly change the mRNA levels of App and PS1 genes (P > 0.05) (Figure 5, H and J). These data demonstrate that, consistent with the in vitro results, inhibition of GSK3 specifically inhibited Bace1 gene expression and its \u03b2-secretase activity in vivo. Our study has demonstrated that NF-\u03baB signaling is required for GSK3\u03b2\u2019s regulatory effect on BACE1 gene expression in vitro. To confirm this effect in vivo, we examined whether NF-\u03baB activity was affected in APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice administered ARA. EMSA was used to assess NF-\u03baB consensus DNA binding in whole brain lysates. ARA treatment inhibited the binding of NF-\u03baB p65 protein to the cis-acting consensus oligonucleotide probe, resulting in a reduction in the intensity of the p65 NF-\u03baB shifted bands (Figure 6A). The specificity of the bands was confirmed by competition assay with addition of \u00d710 and \u00d7100 unlabeled wild-type NF-\u03baB oligonucleotides (oligos), while the mutant NF-\u03baB oligos did not have any significant effect on the shifted bands (Figure 6B). Consistent with the in vitro experiment, APP23/PS45 mice receiving ARA treatment showed a significant reduction in NF-\u03baB levels to 62.9% \u00b1 6.9% of those in the sham-injected controls (P < 0.005) (Figure 6, C and D). Thus, inhibition of GSK3 signaling attenuates NF-\u03baB binding to cis-acting p65 binding elements by reducing NF-\u03baB levels in the AD transgenic model mice in vivo. ARA reduced NF-\u03baB binding in APP23/PS45 mouse brains.Figure 6ARA reduced NF-\u03baB binding in APP23/PS45 mouse brains. APP23/PS45 mice were injected daily with ARA for 4 weeks, and whole brain lysates were subjected to EMSA. (A) Mice that received ARA had reduced intensity of NF-\u03baB shifted band. n = 3. (B) Whole brain lysates subjected to EMSA was competed with 10- and 100-fold excess of the wild-type and mutant NF-\u03baB oligos to demonstrate the specificity of binding. (C) Daily injections of ARA to APP23/PS45 mice for 6 weeks reduced NF-\u03baB p65 levels in the whole brain lysates. (D) Quantification of the band intensity of NF-\u03baB p65 levels. Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 25 total; *P < 0.005. GSK3 inhibition reduces neuritic plaque formation in the AD model mice. To examine the specific effect of GSK3 signaling on AD pathogenesis, we treated APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice with ARA. The double transgenic mice develop detectable neuritic plaques in the neocortex and hippocampus as early as 1 month of age. The mice were treated with 5 mg/kg ARA at 6 weeks of age daily for 4 weeks, while age-matched control mice received vehicle solution. 4G8 immunostaining and thioflavin-S staining were used to detect A\u03b2-containing neuritic plaques in the brains (ref. 63 and Figure 7). ARA treatment significantly decreased the number of neuritic plaques in the transgenic mice relative to the vehicle-injected group (Figure 7, A and B). Quantification showed that overall ARA treatment reduced plaque number by approximately 50% (23.8 \u00b1 4.7 vs. 10.4 \u00b1 1.3 per slice, P < 0.01) (Figure 7C). Thioflavin-S staining also confirmed that ARA treatment dramatically reduced the number of A\u03b2-containing neuritic plaques in the brains of APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice (Figure 7, D and E). The inhibitory effect of ARA was reversible, and the treated mice (Figure 7G) had plaque numbers similar to those in the control mice (Figure 7F) when examined 3 months after the end of the drug treatment (36.5 \u00b1 5.1 vs. 32.1 \u00b1 4.2, P > 0.05) (Figure 7H). During the 4-week injection period, ARA treatment of the mice did not affect food consumption, and no significant weight changes were observed between the treatment and control groups (data not shown).

Inhibition of GSK3 significantly improves memory deficits in the AD model mice. To investigate whether GSK3 inhibition by ARA treatment affects the memory deficit in AD pathogenesis, we used the Morris water maze to test spatial memory after APP23/PS45 mice received 1 month of ARA treatment (64). In the visible platform tests, ARA-treated and control APP23/PS45 mice had similar escape latency (42.4 \u00b1 4.3 and 44.8 \u00b1 2.7 seconds, P > 0.05) (Figure 8A) and path length (6.6 \u00b1 0.7 m and 6.1 \u00b1 0.5 m, P > 0.05) (Figure 8B), indicating that ARA treatment did not affect mouse mobility or vision. In the hidden platform test, ARA-treated mice showed significant improvements as compared with the vehicle-treated controls. The escape latency on the third and fourth days of the hidden platform test was shorter (12.0 \u00b1 1.6 and 17.4 \u00b1 3.1 seconds) than that of sham-treated mice (23.8 \u00b1 4.0 s and 24.9 \u00b1 2.7 s) (P < 0.05, Figure 8C). The ARA-treated mice swam significantly shorter distances to reach the platform (2.9 \u00b1 0.7 m and 3.2 \u00b1 0.3 m) as compared with control mice (3.7 \u00b1 0.6 and 4.2 \u00b1 0.5 m) on the third and fourth days (P < 0.05, Figure 8D). In the probe trial on the last day of testing, the platform was removed. ARA treatment significantly improved the spatial memory in the APP23/PS45 mice, as these mice spent more time searching for the platform in the appropriate quadrant (Supplemental Figure 3A). The number of times the mice traveled into the third quadrant, where the hidden platform was previously placed, was significantly greater with ARA treatment as compared with control (6.0 \u00b1 1.0 and 2.0 \u00b1 1.2 times, P < 0.05) (Figure 8E). Moreover, ARA-treated mice spent nearly twice as long in the southwest (SW) quadrant, where the platform was originally placed during the hidden platform test (NE 16.3.9% \u00b1 1.3%, SE 19.2% \u00b1 1.6%, SW 44.0% \u00b1 3.1%, NW 20.4% \u00b1 2.0%). The sham-treated mice, however, spent approximately equal amounts of time in each quadrant (NE 24.9% \u00b1 1.9%, SE 20.4% \u00b1 2.0%, SW 28.2% \u00b1 1.7%, NW 26.6% \u00b1 2.1%) (Supplemental Figure 3B). These data demonstrate that inhibition of GSK3 signaling significantly improved the memory deficits seen in the AD model mice. ARA improves memory deficits in AD transgenic mice.Figure 8ARA improves memory deficits in AD transgenic mice. A Morris water maze test consists of 1 day of visible platform trials and 4 days of hidden platform trials, plus a probe trial 24 hours after the last hidden platform trial. Animal movement was tracked and recorded by ANY-maze tracking software. APP23/PS45 mice at 6 weeks were injected daily for 1 month with ARA or a vehicle solution and subjected to the Morris water maze test (n = 26 mice total, 14 ARA-treated and 12 sham-treated).

GSK3 is involved in tau hyperphosphorylation (65), neuronal apoptosis (66), and synaptic dysfunction (67). Moreover, GSK3 signaling has also been implicated in A\u03b2 production and neuritic plaque formation (51, 54, 68). However, the mechanism by which GSK3 affects APP processing and A\u03b2 production has not been clearly elucidated, and its pharmaceutical potential as an effective drug target remains to be validated. The current study clearly indicates that GSK3\u03b2, but not the related GSK3\u03b1 isoform, facilitates A\u03b2 production by upregulating BACE1 gene expression via NF-\u03baB p65 cis-acting elements on the BACE1 gene promoter. The C-terminal end of BACE1 undergoes phosphorylation, which regulates BACE1 trafficking and cellular levels (69, 70). In our study, inhibition of GSK3 signaling did not affect the phosphorylation status of BACE1 (data not shown). Thus, specifically inhibiting GSK3 decreases BACE1 expression and markedly reduces \u03b2-secretase processing of APP and A\u03b2 production, resulting in inhibition of neuritic plaque formation and amelioration of memory deficits in AD model mice. GSK3 appears to be a common molecular link between amyloidogenesis and tau abnormalities in AD pathology. Therefore, GSK3 inhibition has been proposed to be a valid therapeutic target for treating AD. Lithium chloride and valproic acid are known to have some inhibitory effects on GSK3 (71, 72) and have been used in the clinic for many decades for the treatment of bipolar disorders and epilepsy. Recent work has demonstrated that lithium and valproic acid could reduce A\u03b2 levels and improve cognitive performance in mouse models of AD (54, 68). While the inhibitory effects of lithium and valproic acid on GSK3 are known, both compounds have also been found to affect signaling cascades independent of GSK3. To further investigate the role of GSK3 on APP processing, we administered ARA, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of GSK3 (IC50 = 104 \u00b1 27 nM) (73) to APP Swedish stable cell lines and APP23/PS45 mice. We found that with specific GSK3 inhibition, the BACE1 major product C99 is reduced, accompanied by a significant reduction in A\u03b2 levels. Previous reports indicated that ARA treatment reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and tangle formation in transgenic mice overexpressing human tau, a model of AD (62). Our study shows that ARA also reduces plaque pathology and rescues cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model. However, continuous ARA treatment is required in order to reduce plaque pathology, as APP23/PS45 mice sacrificed 3 months after the last injection had plaque levels similar to those in the control group. Previous work by Phiel et al. (51) demonstrated that inhibition of GSK3\u03b1 with isoform-specific siRNA decreases \u03b3-secretase activity but found no effect of GSK3\u03b2. In our study, we found that in a system in which \u03b3-secretase activity is pharmacologically inhibited, GSK3\u03b1 knockdown did not have any significant effect on APP processing. On the other hand, GSK3\u03b2 knockdown with inhibition of \u03b3-secretase activity reduced the level of C99 fragment, indicating that BACE1 activity is affected. We further provided evidence that knocking down GSK3\u03b2 reduced BACE1 mRNA levels, but knocking down GSK3\u03b1 did not affect BACE1 expression. Previous genetic studies have found that during development GSK3\u03b1 could not compensate for the loss of GSK3\u03b2, as Gsk3b-KO mice are embryonic lethal while Gsk3a-KO mice are viable (61). This argues that GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 isoforms may have distinct cellular functions with respect to BACE1 expression. Moreover, GSK3\u03b2 is the predominant isoform in the brain and therefore has been implicated in many CNS disorders (74). However, Jaworski et al. recently showed the GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 knockout mice did not show any changes to APP processing and A\u03b2 production (52). This could be due to a physiological compensation of BACE1 expression in the KO mice compared with the acute effect of the GSK3 inhibitor. Additionally, our data showed that GSK3\u03b2 regulated NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated BACE1 expression. Gsk3a knockout had no effect on NF-\u03baB signaling. Taken together, these studies suggest that GSK3 isoforms have distinct roles in regulating APP processing. We do not believe that gene silencing of GSK3 isoforms would be a valid approach for treating AD. Complete ablation of each isoform may lead to compensatory elevated activity of the other isoform or even other functionally protein kinases. Moreover, it has been reported that complete ablation of GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 expression in mice results in various abnormalities (75), which may interfere with any therapeutic values. Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested a significant inflammatory component in AD (76\u201379). However, it remains controversial whether neuroinflammation is a driving force for AD or simply a byproduct of the disease (80). Moreover, the detrimental role of astrocyte and microglia during neuroinflammation remains elusive. The release of various proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines has been shown to affect APP processing, A\u03b2 production, and neurodegenerative changes in AD brains. There have been preclinical studies to show that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or anti-inflammatory cytokines have beneficial effects in treating AD (80, 81). However, there are reports demonstrating that anti-inflammatory stimuli could potentiate A\u03b2 production, possibly through suppression of glia-mediated A\u03b2 clearance. On the other hand, proinflammatory stimuli could also have extreme effects on AD pathogenesis. There is a large amount of evidence to show that increased proinflammatory cytokines correlates with A\u03b2 production and neurodegeneration. In contrast, there are also a number of studies indicating that proinflammatory cytokines precondition the system for A\u03b2 challenge and protect against neurodegeneration (82\u201385). Clearly, inflammation is a major component of the AD brain, and more work will be required in order to elucidate its role in AD pathogenesis. Since several proinflammatory cytokines including the interleukins and TNF have been found to activate GSK3\u03b2, and GSK3 inhibitors showed anti-inflammatory effects (86\u201388), we speculate that GSK3 plays an important role in the inflammatory response driving A\u03b2 production. The chronic inflammatory response induced by A\u03b2 may depend on transcription factors to exert neurodegenerative effects. Regulation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and its transcriptional activity may in part play a role in A\u03b2-mediated neurodegeneration (27, 89). It has been previously reported that the BACE1 promoter contains NF-\u03baB\u2013binding elements (27, 90) and exacerbated A\u03b2 levels modulate the BACE1 promoter activity via NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent pathways (91). More recently, Chen et al. (27) found increased NF-\u03baB p65 and BACE1 expression in postmortem AD brains. Furthermore, overexpression of NF-\u03baB p65 was found to increase human BACE1 promoter activity, whereas inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling reduced BACE1 expression (27). Exogenous application of A\u03b2 has been found to increase GSK3\u03b2 activity and NF-\u03baB levels. There are many reports suggesting that GSK3\u03b2 regulates gene transcription in an NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent manner (61, 92, 93). Therefore, we argue that the GSK3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is involved in regulating BACE1 gene transcription. In this study, we found that interfering with GSK3\u03b2 activity using Gsk3b-KO cells or ARA treatment reduced BACE1 promoter activity and gene expression. Moreover, disrupting NF-\u03baB expression also blocked GSK3\u03b2-induced BACE1 transcription. Long-term treatment with GSK3 inhibitors always raises the concern about unwanted side effects. Many of the Wnt signal transduction components such as the APC gene or \u03b2-catenin gene carry mutations that render the protein nondegradable (94). Prolonged activation of the Wnt pathway has been linked to development of various cancers (95). GSK3 inhibitors including SB216763, SB415286, Kenpaullone, and lithium chloride have all been shown to elevate the level of \u03b2-catenin (51, 96, 97). Consequently, it may be possible that GSK3 inhibitors may mimic Wnt signaling and could potentially be oncogenic. However, long-term use of lithium chloride to treat bipolar disorder has not been linked to increased risk of cancer. Interestingly, administration of the GSK3 inhibitors CHIR99021 and ARA did not change \u03b2-catenin levels (65). Moreover, \u03b2-catenin levels are largely unaffected in Gsk3b-KO embryos (61). These findings indicate that the inhibition of GSK3 by itself might not be sufficient to elevate the level of \u03b2-catenin. It is possible that there are specific pools of GSK3 that are insensitive to certain GSK3 inhibitors, thereby sparing the effect of increasing \u03b2-catenin levels. In order to validate the therapeutic efficacy of GSK3 inhibition, while minimizing oncogenic side effects, long-term treatment studies in cells and animals will be required. In conclusion, we have found that the GSK3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway regulates BACE1 transcription and thereby facilitates A\u03b2 production in AD. Since GSK3\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB are involved in AD pathogenesis, our results suggest that direct interference of this pathway may be a promising drug target for AD therapy.

S9A-GSK3\u03b2 gene induction was achieved by stimulation with 1 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline (60). Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using either calcium phosphate or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). L685,458, G2, and ARA (EMD Biosciences) were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with complete cell culture medium. The final DMSO concentrations in each experiment were less than 0.5%. Luciferase assay. BACE1 promoter constructs were transfected into N2a cells and wild-type and Gsk3b-KO MEFs. The Renilla (sea pansy) luciferase vector pCMV-Rluc was co-transfected to normalize transfection efficiency. A luciferase assay was performed 48 hours after transfection with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) as previously described (27). Semiquantitative RT-PCR. RNA was isolated from cells using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). A Thermoscript Reverse Transcription kit (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA from an equal amount of RNA following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The newly synthesized cDNA templates were further amplified via Platinum Taq DNA polymerase in a 20-\u03bcl reaction. The following primers were used to specifically amplify BACE1, GSK3A, GSK3B, APP, and PS1 genes: BACE1 forward 5\u2032-cccgcagacgctcaacatcc and reverse 5\u2032-GCCACTGTCCACAATGCTCTT; GSK3A forward 5\u2032-TGAAGCTGGGCCGTGACAGCGG and reverse 5\u2032-ACATGTACACCTTGACATAG; GSK3B forward 5\u2032-TCAGGAGTGCGGGTCTTCCGAC and reverse 5\u2032-CTCCAGTATTAGCATCTGACGCT; APP forward 5\u2032-GCTGGCCTGCTGGCTGAACC and reverse 5\u2032-GGCGACGGTGTGCCAGTGAA; PS1 forward 5\u2032-GAGACACAGGACAGTGGTTCTGG and reverse 5\u2032-GGCCGATCAGTATGGCTACAAA. \u03b2-Actin was used as an internal control. The samples were resolved and analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel. Immunoblot analysis. Brain tissues or cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 4% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) supplemented with 200 mM sodium orthovanadate, 25 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM PMSF, and a complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche Diagnostics). The samples were diluted in 4\u00d7 SDS-sample buffer, boiled, and resolved on 12% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE or 16% Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvindylidine fluoride (PVDF-FL) membranes. For immunoblot analysis, membranes were blocked for 1 hour in PBS containing 5% nonfat dried milk, followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C in primary antibodies diluted in the blocking medium. Rabbit anti-APP C-terminal polyclonal antibody C20 was used to detect APP and its CTF products. PS1 was detected by anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody 231. Total GSK3\u03b2 was determined using a pan-specific mouse anti-GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 antibody (BioSource International Inc.). Total \u03b2-catenin was determined using a pan-specific rabbit anti\u2013\u03b2-catenin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). The NF-\u03baB p65 subunit was determined using mouse anti-p65 (Sigma-Aldrich). Internal control \u03b2-actin was analyzed using monoclonal antibody AC-15 (Sigma-Aldrich). BACE1 was detected with the anti-BACE1 antibody 208 recognizing the C-terminal end (101). A\u03b240/42 ELISA. HEK293 cells stably expressing the human APP gene containing the Swedish mutation were maintained in cell culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS. Following ARA treatment for 24 hours, conditioned medium was harvested, and protease inhibitors and AEBSF (Roche Diagnostics) were added to prevent degradation of A\u03b2 peptides. APP23/PS45 double transgenic mouse cortical tissues were prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions prior to carrying out the ELISA protocol (Invitrogen). The concentration of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 were detected using an A\u03b21\u201340 or A\u03b21\u201342 Colorimetric ELISA kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. EMSA. Whole brain extracts were prepared by homogenizing the tissue in Buffer C (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitor. EMSA was performed as previously described with a few changes (102). Briefly, 20\u201340 \u03bcg protein was incubated with an IRDye 700\u2013labeled NF-\u03baB oligo (5\u2032-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC), and the gels were scanned using the Odyssey system (LI-COR Biosciences). In the competition assay, unlabeled wild-type and mutant (5\u2032-AGTTGAGGCCACTTTCCCAGGC) NF-\u03baB oligos at \u00d710 and \u00d7100 molar excess were used to compete for binding. Transgenic mice and drug treatment. APP23 mice overexpressing the Swedish APP751 (KM\u2192NL) mutant transgene driven by the mouse Thy1.2 promoter were originally generated at Novartis Pharma as previously described (30, 103). APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice were generated by crossing APP23 mice with mice overexpressing the human G384A-mutated PS1 under the control of the murine Thy1 promoter (B6,D2-TgN(Thy1-PS1G384A)45) (54, 103\u2013105). APP23 and PS45 mice had been backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice for more than 7 generations prior to breeding for the double transgenic mice. The genotype of the mice was confirmed by PCR using DNA from tail tissues. The treatment group contained 14 animals (8 females, 6 males), and the sham-injected group contained 12 animals (7 females, 5 males). The treatment group received 5 mg/kg ARA diluted in 0.9% saline daily via intraperitoneal injection at the same time each day. Mice in the control group were injected with the vehicle solution containing DMSO diluted in 0.9% saline only. We tabulated the daily food consumption and weight for each mouse. Immunohistochemical staining. Mice were sacrificed after behavioral testing, and half brains were immediately homogenized for protein, RNA, or DNA extraction. The other halves of the brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned with a Leica Cryostat to 30-\u03bcm thickness. Every twelfth slice with the same reference position was mounted onto slides for staining. Immunocytochemical staining was performed on floating sections. The plaques in the sections were detected with biotinylated monoclonal 4G8 antibody (Signetlabs) in 1:500 dilution, visualized by the ABC and DAB method, and counted under a \u00d740 objective as previously described (54, 63). Plaques were quantified, and the average plaque count per slice was recorded for each mouse. Thioflavin-S staining of plaques was performed with 1% thioflavin-S visualized using fluorescence microscopy (54). Morris water maze test. The Morris water maze test was performed as previously described (30, 64). The APP23/PS45 mice treated with or without ARA were subjected to the Morris water maze test 1 day after the last injection regimen. The test was performed in a 1.5-meter-diameter pool with a 10-cm-diameter platform placed in the SE quadrant of the pool. The procedure consisted of 1 day of visible platform tests and 4 days of hidden platform tests, plus a probe trial 24 hours after the last hidden platform test. In the visible platform test performed on the first day, the mice were tested for 5 continuous trials, with an inter-trial interval of 60 minutes. In the hidden platform tests, mice were trained for 5 trials, with an inter-trial interval of 1 hour. Each mouse was allowed 60 seconds to search for the platform. In the scenario where the mouse could not locate the platform, the experiment guided it to the platform and allowed the mouse to rest there for 15 seconds. On the last day of the test, each mouse was subjected to the probe trial in which the platform was removed. Each mouse was given 60 seconds to locate where the platform was originally placed. Mouse behavior including distance traveled, escape latency and the number of passes through the platform was recorded by automated video tracking (ANY-maze, Stoelting). The data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. Statistics. All results were presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and analyzed by ANOVA or 2-tailed Student\u2019s t-test. Statistical significance is accepted when P < 0.05. Study approval. Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the University of British Columbia Animal Care and Use Committee and Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) guidelines.Supplemental dataView Supplemental dataAcknowledgmentsWe thank Steven R.

Up-regulation of Seladin-1 reduces the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid and neuronal death. Thyroid hormone (TH) exerts an important effect on the development and maintenance of central nervous systems. In the current study, we demonstrated that Seladin-1 gene and protein expression in the forebrain was increased in thyrotoxic mice compared with that of euthyroid mice. However, unexpectedly, no significant decrease in the gene and protein expression was observed in hypothyroid mice. Interestingly, an agonist of liver X receptor (LXR), TO901317 (TO) administration in vivo increased Seladin-1 gene and protein expression in the mouse forebrain only in a hypothyroid state and in the presence of mutant TR-\u03b2, suggesting that LXR-\u03b1 would compensate for TR-\u03b2 function to maintain Seladin-1 gene expression in hypothyroidism and resistance to TH. TH activated the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (\u22121936/+21 bp) and site 2 including canonical TH response element (TRE) half-site in the region between \u2212159 and \u2212154 bp is responsible for the positive regulation. RXR-\u03b1/TR-\u03b2 heterodimerization was identified on site 2 by gel-shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed the recruitment of TR-\u03b2 to site 2 and the recruitment was increased upon TH administration. On the other hand, LXR-\u03b1 utilizes a distinct region from site 2 (\u2212120 to \u2212102 bp) to activate the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter. Taking these findings together, we concluded that TH up-regulates Seladin-1 gene expression at the transcriptional level and LXR-\u03b1 maintains the gene expression.Citation: Ishida E, Hashimoto K, Okada S, Satoh T, Yamada M, et al.

However, the pathogenesis of the disease has not yet been revealed.Thyroid hormone (TH) is well known to play an important role in the development and maintenance of the central nervous system in mammals [3], [4]. TH exerts its biological function through thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). TRs are nuclear hormone receptors, to which triiodothyronine (T3) binds at a high-affinity order as a native ligand. TRs possess at least two isoforms, TR-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 (Nr1a1 and Nr1a2), and several isoforms exist as two or three subtypes, respectively (\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21, \u03b22, and \u03b23) [5]. It is of note that only TR-\u03b11, \u03b21 and \u03b22 have both a ligand binding and a DNA binding domain [6]. TR-\u03b11 is widely expressed in tissues including heart, muscle, intestine, bone, and brain and plays a key role in regulating postnatal development and cardiac metabolism, whereas TR-\u03b21 is also widely expressed in brain, cochlea, pituitary, kidney, lung, heart and at its highest level in the liver regulating multiple steps in hepatic metabolism as well as thyroid hormone levels [6]. TR-\u03b22 expression is mainly in the pituitary, the hypothalamic TRH neurons, the developing inner ear and retina [7]. Thus, both TR-\u03b1 and TR-\u03b2 play an important role for the development and the maintenance of the central nervous system even though their expression patterns are spatiotemporally distinct [8]\u2013[10]. Hypothyroidism sometimes leads to the development of dementia-like symptoms, especially in elderly patients [11], [12]. The TH receptor (TR) \u03b2-\u0394337T knock-in (TRKI) mouse demonstrates severe cerebellar ataxia and cognitive dysfunction [13]. As such, although case reports and basic studies support the idea that TH is closely related to AD pathogenesis and could be beneficial to cure AD [14]\u2013[16], large-scale clinical studies examining the relationship between thyroid function and AD have led to controversial conclusions [17]\u2013[20].Among many genes related to AD, we focused on selective AD indicator 1, Seladin-1 gene. Seladin-1 gene expression is down-regulated in the vulnerable region in the brain of AD patients [21]. Up-regulation of Seladin-1 in the neuron leads to the reduction of \u03b2-amyloid accumulation and apoptosis [21]\u2013[23]. Seladin-1 gene codes 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), which catalyzes the final step of cholesterol synthesis [24]. Cholesterol inside the neuron inhibits co-localization of \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE), protecting \u03b2-amyloid accumulation [22], [25]. Thus, cholesterol in the neuron is responsible for maintenance of neural function [25]. Seladin-1 protects the neuron by increasing the intracellular cholesterol synthesis [21], [22], [26]. In a previous report, TH administration to some neuronal precursor cell lines induced Seladin-1 gene expression [27]. However, the molecular mechanism by which TH up-regulates Seladin-1 mRNA levels is yet to be elucidated.Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear oxysterol receptors and play pivotal roles in cholesterol metabolism [28], [29]. LXRs comprise two isoforms, LXR-\u03b1 and -\u03b2. Both isoforms are expressed in the brain, although the latter is expressed at significantly higher levels [30]. An artificial agonist of LXR, TO901317 (TO), reduces \u03b2-amyloid accumulation and AD-specific pathological changes in the brain of an AD model mouse [31]\u2013[33]. Since LXR response element (LXRE) is identified in the second intron in human Seladin-1 gene promoter, another group has suggested that Seladin-1 gene promoter may be a target of LXR [34]. However, the molecular mechanism by which LXRs regulate Seladin-1 gene expression has been yet to be elucidated.TRs and LXRs are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Although LXRs and TRs belong to two distinct receptor subgroups with respect to ligand-binding affinity [35], the two receptor systems show similarity with respect to molecular mechanism, target genes, and physiological roles [36]. Since both TRs and LXRs play an important role in metabolic regulation, form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs), and bind to direct repeat-4 (DR-4) with identical geometry and polarity [28], [36]\u2013[38], crosstalk between the two receptors has been reported, especially on lipid metabolism-related genes [37]\u2013[43].In the current study, we demonstrate that TH increased Seladin-1 gene and protein expression in the mouse forebrain. However, no significant difference between euthyroid and hypothyroid mice was observed. Interestingly, TO administration in vivo increased Seladin-1 gene and protein expression in the mouse forebrain only in a hypothyroid state and in the presence of mutant TR-\u03b2. We also show that TH activates mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter and identify a novel positive thyroid hormone response element named site 2 including canonical thyroid hormone response element (TRE) half-site in the mouse promoter. Taking these findings together, we concluded that TH up-regulates Seladin-1 gene expression at the transcriptional level and that LXR-\u03b1 would compensate for TR-\u03b2 function to maintain Seladin-1 gene expression in hypothyroidism and resistance to TH (RTH). Thus, our data strongly suggests that TR and LXR crosstalk in Seladin-1 gene regulation.Materials and MethodsAnimals8 to 12-week-old male C57/BL6 (B6) and TRKI mice (generously provided by Prof. Fredric E. Wondisford, Johns Hopkins medical institute, Baltimore) were employed for the study. All aspects of animal care were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine (Maebashi, Gunma, Japan, Protocol number #10-059). Animals were maintained on a 12 h light/12 h dark schedule (lights on at 06:00 h) and fed laboratory chow as indicated and given water ad libitum. Hypothyroidism was induced in the B6 mice by the inclusion of 0.1% methimazole (MMI) in the drinking water and 1% (w/w) propylthiouracil (PTU) in the chow for 21 days [37], [41]. To induce a thyrotoxic state, the B6 mice were injected daily with 10 \u00b5g per 20 g body weight of T3 for 7 days [37]. For TO treatment, 1 mg per 20 g body weight of TO901317 (#71810 Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI) was intraperitoneally administered daily for 7 days [31], [33] or vehicle (DMSO) was administered for Sham group. The number of mice receiving each treatment is indicated in the figures. Serum-free T3 and T4 levels were measured by SRL (Tokyo, Japan). We anatomically excised cerebellum, diencephalon, pituitary, hypothalamus, and medulla oblongata from the whole brain of mouse and obtained the rest as forebrain for the analysis as we reported previously [13].PlasmidsThe mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (\u22121936/+21 bp) plasmid, which contained the region from \u22121936 to +21 bp of the mouse Seladin-1 gene, was generated by genomic PCR using 5\u2032-GTGTGGTACCTGGTGGCAGGAGAGAGCCCC-3\u2032 as a sense primer and 5\u2032-GTGTAGATCTGTAAGTCGGGCCCGCCGCC-3\u2032 as an anti-sense primer. An Asp718 or BglII restriction enzyme site was introduced into each primer sequence so that the PCR product could be subcloned between these sites in the pGL4-Luc vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The deletion mutants and a site 1 or site 2 point mutants were generated with PCR site-directed mutagenesis [37], [43], [44]. All human TR-\u03b21 and its mutants, human TR-\u03b11, RXR-\u03b1, murine LXR-\u03b1, and LXR-\u03b2 cDNAs were placed into an SV40 expression construct, pSG5 [44]. All PCR-generated constructs were verified by sequencing the DNA.Transfections and Luciferase AssayFor the luciferase assay, we employed CV-1 cells. 10 \u00b5g of the reporter plasmid and 0.25 \u00b5g of human TR-\u03b21 or TR-\u03b11 or mouse LXR-\u03b11 or LXR-\u03b2 in pSG5 was transfected per plate of a 6-well format into CV-1 cells using the calcium-phosphate method. Sixteen hours after transfection, cultures were treated with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) containing 10% resin charcoal double-stripped fetal bovine serum for 8 hours in the absence or presence of 10\u22128 M T3 or 10\u22126 M TO. All transfections were equalized for the same total amount of expression vector using an empty vector as needed. We performed \u03b2-gal assays to confirm the transfection efficiency of the luciferase assay for each experiment at least once and found no significant difference in transfection efficiency among the plates. Data are presented as fold basal activation over vector (pSG5) in the absence of ligand stimulation \u00b1 SEM or as otherwise indicated. Luciferase activity is expressed as arbitrary light units per \u00b5g of cellular protein. All transfection experiments were repeated at least twice with triplicate determinations.Western BlottingFor analysis of the protein expression of Seladin-1 (DHCR24), 30 \u00b5g of whole cell extract from mouse forebrain was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed using a rabbit anti-DHCR24 polyclonal antibody (#ab40490, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) to detect Sealdin-1 protein levels and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (#ab8245, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) as a control. The Seladin-1 detects a specific band at 55 kDa in tissues and cells. The bands were quantitatively measured using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems Corp., San Jose, CA) and ImageJ (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/, 1997\u20132011). All Western blotting experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Seladin-1 protein levels are normalized by GAPDH. Data are presented as fold basal euthyroid (E) levels \u00b1 SEM or as otherwise indicated.RNA Preparation and Real-time Quantitative PCRTotal RNA was extracted from mouse forebrain using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). Real-time quantitative PCR assays were performed using an Applied Biosystems 7500 sequence detector with the standard 40 cycles. Briefly, 1 \u00b5g of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers using the TaqmanTM Reverse Transcription Reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Mouse Seladin-1 mRNA expression was analyzed using TaqmanTM probes (Mm00519071_m1, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). We set up a standard curve for each real-time PCR and confirmed that all PCR products were on the standard curve as we previously described [43]. The PCR results were normalized to mouse cyclophilin A expression using a TaqmanTM probe (Mm02342430_gl, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The number of samples is indicated in the figure legends.Gel-shift AssaysElectrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs, gel-shift assays) were performed as described previously [45]. Mouse LXR-\u03b1, human TR-\u03b21, and human RXR-\u03b1 recombinant proteins were synthesized from constructs in the pSG5 expression vector, using the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/ Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI). Binding reactions contained 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mM KCl, 12% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 \u00b5g of poly (dI-dC)(dI-dC), and 6 \u00b5l of each of the synthesized nuclear receptors or unprogrammed reticulocyte lysates. Double-stranded oligonucleotides (DR-4 for rat cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP7A1): 5\u2032- TGTTTGCTTTGGTCACTCAAGTTCAA-3\u2032, Site 1 probe ; 5\u2032- CTCCCACCCTGGGGAGGTTACCCAATGCACAACT-3\u2032, Site 2 probe ; 5\u2032- AGCGCCCCCAGCCCAGGTCAGCCCCTCCTCGCAC-3\u2032) were labeled with [\u03b1-32P] deoxy-CTP by a fill-in reaction using a Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min. For competition experiments, a 20- or 40-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotides was included. For supershift experiments, 3 \u00b5l of rabbit anti-TR-\u03b21 polyclonal antibody (06-539, Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) or mouse anti-LXR-\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (PP-PPZ0412-00, Perseus proteomics, Tokyo, Japan) was added and the mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5X TBE (45 mM Tris-base, 1 mM EDTA). All gel-shift assays were repeated at least three times with similar results and a representative result is shown.Small Interfering (si) RNA against LXRsWe employed Dharmacon\u2019s siRNA against human LXR-\u03b1 (L-003413-00-0005, ON-TARGET plus SMART pool, human NR1H3) and LXR-\u03b2 (L-003412-00-0005, ON-TARGET plus SMART pool, human NR1H2) (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). The target sequences of siRNA for human LXR-\u03b1 are as follows: 5\u2032-GAGUUUGCCUUGCUCAUUG-3\u2032; 5\u2032-CGACUGAUGUUCCCACGGA-3\u2032; 5\u2032-GAACAACUGGGCAUGAUCG-3\u2032; 5\u2032-CCUCAAGGAUUUCAGUUAU-3\u2032, and the target sequences for LXR-\u03b2 were as follows: 5\u2032-AACAGCGGCUCAAGAACUA-3\u2032; 5\u2032-CUAAGCAAGUGCCUGGUUU-3\u2032; 5\u2032-GAAGAAGAUUCGGAAACAG-3\u2032; 5\u2032-CAACCACGAGACAGAGUGU-3\u2032. SiRNA for the negative control (ON-TARGET plus Non-targeting pool, D-001810-10-20, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA) was employed. SiRNAs were transfected into HTB185 cells, derived from human medulloblastoma using the lipofection method (Lipofectamine RNAiMAX, Invitrogen). Briefly, in the 6-well format, 50 pmol of siRNAs against each LXR (\u03b1 or \u03b2) or 100 pmol of non-targeting siRNA per well were transfected into the HTB185 cells. Sixteen hours after transfection, cultures were treated with DMEM containing 10% resin charcoal double-stripped fetal bovine serum for 8 hours in the absence or presence of 10\u22126 M TO. After incubation, total RNA was extracted from the cells and real-time quantitative PCR assays were performed as described above. Human Seladin-1, LXR-\u03b1 and LXR-\u03b2 mRNA expression levels were analyzed using TaqmanTM probes (Hs00207388_m1, Hs00172885_m1 and Hs00173195_m1, respectively. Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) AssayChIP assays were performed using a kit (ChIP-ITTM Express) from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s protocol with some modifications. Briefly, in prior to ChIP assays, the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (\u22121113/+21 bp) in pGL4 was transfected into the HTB185 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The transfected HTB185 cells were incubated in medium containing 10% resin-charcoal double-stripped fetal bovine serum with or without 10\u22128 M T3. After incubation, formaldehyde (37%) was directly added to the culture at a final concentration of 1% and the cells were incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C to crosslink protein to DNA. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 600 \u00b5l of lysis buffer supplemented with 3 \u00b5l of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PIC) and 0.5 mM PMSF and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. The resuspended cells were passed through a 27G syringe 10 times to aid nucleus release. The nucleus pellet was resuspended in 210 \u00b5l of Shearing Buffer (supplemented with 1.05 \u00b5l of PIC) and the samples were placed on ice. The nucleus lysate was sonicated 4 times with 10-sec pulses using a sonicator set at 50% of maximum power to reduce DNA length to between 200 and 1000 bp. Sheared chromatin solution (50 \u00b5l) was used for each ChIP assay with 2 \u00b5g of a mouse anti-TR-\u03b2 monoclonal antibody (PP-H3825A-00, Perseus proteomics, Tokyo, Japan), mouse anti-LXR-\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (PP-K8607-00, Perseus proteomics, Tokyo, Japan) and rabbit anti-RXR-\u03b1 polyclonal antibody (sc-774, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). As a negative control, normal rabbit IgG (#2729, Cell Signaling Technology, Denver, CO) was used. For Ct value-based evaluation of ChIP results, quantitative PCR was performed with power SYBR Green (#4367659, Applied Biosystems) in Applied Biosystems 7500 sequence detector by using 1 \u00b5l of immunoprecipitate or input according to the manufacturer\u2019s specified parameters. The primers used for the region between \u2212226 bp and +21 bp for quantitative PCR were as follows: forward 5\u2032-CTCCAGAGCGAGAGCCCTAA-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-GTAAGTCGGGCCCGCCGCCT-3\u2032. The predicted PCR product was 247 bp long. The values were corrected using the input values and presented as %input \u00b1 SEM. All ChIP assays were repeated at least twice with triplicate determinations.Statistical AnalysesStatistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and parametric Welch\u2019s t-test or nonparametric Mann-Whitney test [46], [47] where appropriate to assess statistical differences between means with Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) and JMP (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Values are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM).ResultsT3 Up-regulates Seladin-1 Gene Expression in the Mouse ForebrainTo examine whether TH regulates mouse Seladin-1 gene expression, we performed real-time RT-PCR using mouse forebrain steady-state total RNA. For this purpose, we first rendered the B6 mice in a hypothyroid state (H) with an MMI/PTU diet, or made them thyrotoxic (T) with T3 administration intraperitoneally (Figure 1A, 1B). TH levels (free T4 and free T3) are shown in Table 1. As shown in Figure 1A, when T3 was administered to 8- to 12-week-old B6 mice intraperitoneally, Seladin-1 gene expression levels in the forebrain were increased about 2.5-fold. Unexpectedly, mice in a hypothyroid state did not show significant down-regulation of Seladin-1 gene compared to the control. We obtained a similar result for protein expression levels (Figure 1B).thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 1.

Unexpectedly, as shown in Figure 2A, TO did not change Seladin-1 gene expression levels in the forebrain of B6 mice in the basal status. However, in a hypothyroid state, TO increased Seladin-1 gene expression levels in the forebrain (by 2.1 fold, Figure 2C). We obtained a similar result for protein expression levels (Figure 2B, 2D). As previously reported [41], free T4 levels of TRKI mice (homozygous mice), which demonstrates severe thyroid dysfunction were extremely high (over 7.77 ng/dl) because of RTH (data not shown). However, Seladin-1 mRNA and protein levels in the forebrain of TRKI mice were comparable to those of wild-type (WT) mice (Figure 3A, 3B). On the other hand, as shown in Figure 3C, administration of TO significantly increased Seladin-1 gene expression in the forebrain of TRKI mice compared with that of Sham group about 1.2-fold. We obtained a similar result for protein expression levels (Figure 3D). These lines of evidence supported our hypothesis; LXRs compensate to maintain Seladin-1 gene expression in hypothyroidism and/or in TR-\u03b2 dysfunction.thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 2.

We employed this reporter construct and performed luciferase assays with CV-1 cells, which are known to be deficient for endogenous TRs [45]. When we co-transfected the gene promoter (\u22121936/+21 bp) with TR-\u03b21 into CV-1 cells, T3 significantly activated the promoter activity, however the up-regulation was not observed with co-transfection of TR-\u03b11 (Figure 4A). These data indicated that TH activates mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter via TR-\u03b2. Next, we prepared a series of deletion constructs of the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (Figure 4B), which were subjected to transfection into CV-1 cells with these reporters together with TR-\u03b21. As shown in Figure 4C, the \u2212136/+21 construct was not activated by T3. We identified two TRE half-sites, one is located from \u2212304 to \u2212299 bp and the other one is located from \u2212159 to \u2212154 bp in the mouse Seladin-1 promoter and hypothesized that these TRE half site regions could be a novel positive TRE. We referred to the upstream and downstream region as site 1 and 2, respectively. We introduced mutation into the TRE half-site in site 1 and 2 in the context of the \u22121936/+21 reporter (Figure 4D, upper panel). As shown in Figure 4E, lower panel, the positive regulation by T3 deteriorated in the mutt 2 reporter, indicating that the TRE half-site in site 2 is functionally important.thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 4.

NS: not significant.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054901.g004 TR-\u03b21 DNA Binding is Essential for Positive Regulation of Mouse Seladin-1 Gene PromoterWe co-transfected several types of mutant TR-\u03b21 and the \u22121936/+21 reporter into CV-1 cells. As shown in Figure 4F, GS125, a DNA binding mutant [49], \u0394337T, a ligand binding mutant [50], [51], and R427Q [51], [52], a heterodimerization mutant with RXR-\u03b1, did not activate the promoter, whereas E457A, a co-activator binding mutant [53], positively regulated mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter activity as wild-type TR-\u03b21. These data suggest that ligand binding, TR-\u03b21 DNA binding, and heterodimerization with RXR-\u03b1 are required for the positive regulation.RXR-\u03b1/TR-\u03b21 Heterodimer Binds to Site 2Since we found that site 2 is functionally important for the positive regulation of the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter based on the reporter assay data (Figure 4E), we hypothesized that TR-\u03b21 could bind to site 2 in the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter. To investigate this, we employed oligonucleotides for site 1, encompassing \u2212318 to \u2212285 bp and for site 2, from \u2212173 to \u2212140 bp in the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter, including the TRE consensus half-site motif. We performed electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs) with the radiolabeled site 1 and 2 probes (Figure 5A). As shown in Figure 5B, it was revealed that RXR-\u03b1/TR-\u03b21 heterodimer bound to site 2 but not to site 1. Anti-TR-\u03b2 antibody shifted the heterodimer band, indicating that the binding was TR-\u03b2-specific. In addition, either RXR-\u03b1/TR-\u03b11 heterodimer or TR-\u03b11 homodyne did not bind to site 2 (data not shown).thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 5.

As shown in Figure 6A, TO significantly increased human Seladin-1 gene expression about 1.5 fold (left graph). In addition, induction of siRNA against LXR-\u03b1/\u03b2 into HTB185 cells revealed that TO did not increase the gene expression in LXRs knockdown-HTB185 cells (Figure 6A, right graph). These data indicate that TO increases Seladin-1 gene expression in HTB185 cells through intrinsic LXRs. We confirmed LXR-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 gene expression levels in the HTB 185 cells, which siRNA against LXR-\u03b1/\u03b2 was induced (Figure 6B). It revealed that both LXR isoform gene expression levels were significantly reduced in the LXRs knockdown cells. In addition, TO induced the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (\u22121936/+21 bp) in CV-1 cells in the presence of LXR-\u03b1 or LXR-\u03b2 indicating that both isoforms potentiate to activate the gene promoter upon TO administration (Figure 6C). However, as shown in Figure 6B, since the gene expression of LXR-\u03b1 was robust compared to that of LXR-\u03b2, we concluded that LXR-\u03b1 is the dominant isoform in HTB185 cells. Thus, we employed LXR-\u03b1 for further analysis of the up-regulation of mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter by TO.thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 6.

An analysis of deletion constructs of the gene promoter revealed that the \u2212102/+21 construct was not activated by TO indicating that the region from \u2212120 to \u2212102 bp but not site 2 is responsible for the positive regulation (Figure 7A). Moreover, EMSA demonstrated that LXR-\u03b1 or RXR-\u03b1/LXR-\u03b1 heterodimer did not bind to site 2 (Figure 7B).

We introduced the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (\u22121113 to +21 bp) in HTB185 cells by transient transfection. As shown in Figure 8B, in HTB185 cells, the recruitment of intrinsic TR-\u03b2 to the \u2212226 to +21 bp region significantly increased upon T3 administration. Since the set of PCR primer covers the region from \u2212120 to \u2212102 bp, with which LXR-\u03b1 should interact, LXR-\u03b1 recruitment to the region was observed in the absence of TH, but TH significantly reduced the recruitment.thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 8.

NS: not significant.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054901.g008 DiscussionIn the current study, we demonstrated that mouse Seladin-1 mRNA and protein levels in forebrain were up-regulated by TH administration in vivo. We have obtained some controversial results from the in vivo study. While Seladin-1 gene expression is induced in a thyrotoxic state, under hypothyroid treatment, the gene and protein expression levels were not significantly reduced compared to those in a euthyroid state (Figure 1). Moreover, no significant differences in the gene expression between wild-type and TRKI mice, which was expected to recapitulate hypothyroid state in the forebrain, were found (Figure 3A and 3B). This in vivo data indicated a compensation to maintain the gene expression should exist. First, we tried to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which TH up-regulates the gene expression and we demonstrated that the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter was activated by T3 in CV-1 cells. Benvenuti et al. reported that TH up-regulates the Seladin-1 gene expression in in vitro model of human neuronal precursor cell lines [27]. They conformed that TR-\u03b11, TR-\u03b21 and TR-\u03b22 genes were expressed in these neuronal precursor cell lines, however it was unclear whether the up-regulation of the Seladin-1 gene expression by T3 was isoform specific. It is well known that both TR-\u03b1 and TR-\u03b2 are important for the development and maintenance of central nervous system in mammals and other species [7]\u2013[10], [54]. Thus, we examined the activation of the Seladin-1 gene promoter by T3 could be TR isoform specific and found that TR-\u03b2 but not TR-\u03b1 is responsible for the positive regulation (Figure 4A). The gene promoter investigated in the current study contains two consensus TRE-half sites; site 1 and 2. Through the analysis of deletion mutant promoters and EMSAs, we have identified site 2 as a novel positive TRE. Estrogen receptor (ER) is another nuclear receptor closely related to Seladin-1 gene expression. Estrogens are well known to exert neurotropic and neuroprotective effects in vitro [55], [56] and increase Seladin-1 gene expression in fetal neuroepithelial cells [57]. Similar to site 2 for TR, half-palindromic estrogen response element (ERE) in Seladin-1 gene promoter is functionally responsible for the promoter activation by ER [58].The ChIP assays using HTB185 cells revealed that TR-\u03b2 is recruited to site 2 flanking region and that the recruitment is augmented upon T3 administration. Generally, TR-\u03b2 as a type 2 nuclear receptor should constitutively bind to DNA in the gene promoter in the presence or absence of T3; however, recently, Liu et al. reported that TR-\u03b2 was recruited to the TRE in a T3-dose-dependent manner in a time-course study [59]. Our data regarding TR-\u03b2 recruitment is congruent with this report by Liu et al. The study employing several types of TR-\u03b2 mutant revealed that the positive regulation of the promoter by TR-\u03b2 required ligand binding, DNA binding, and heterodimerization with RXR-\u03b1, and that co-activator binding does not seem to be necessarily required for the regulation (Figure 4F).Crosstalk between TR-\u03b2 and LXR-\u03b1 has been reported, especially on lipid metabolism-related genes. Recently, several types of crosstalk between TRs and LXRs have been identified and crosstalk has also been observed in other physiological systems such as central nervous system other than lipid metabolism [5], [41], [48]. Therefore, we hypothesized that LXR-\u03b1 could compensate to maintain mouse Seladin-1 gene expression in hypothyroid status and in the TRKI mice. Supporting our hypothesis, TO, an artificial agonist of LXRs, induced the gene expression in a hypothyroid state (Figure 2C, 2D) and in TRKI mice (Figure 3C, 3D), but not in euthyroid state (Figure 2A, 2B). Since TO clearly increased Seladin-1 gene expression in HTB185 cells through intrinsic LXRs and induced the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter activity in CV-1 cells, Seladin-1 is considered as an LXR target gene. Wang et al. reported that Seladin-1 gene expression in the brain of LXR-\u03b2 knockout mice was not decreased compared to that of wild-type mice [34]. We speculate that it is due to that TR-\u03b2 dominantly regulates Seladin-1 gene expression in mice. Another speculation is that LXR-\u03b2 could not be required for the regulation of mouse Seladin-1 gene in forebrain.We demonstrated that LXR-\u03b1 is a dominant isoform in HTB185 cells, in which Seladin-1 gene expression was positively regulated by TO (Figure 6), therefore we employed LXR-\u03b1 to elucidate a molecular mechanism for the positive regulation of the gene. Based on the data obtained by the analysis of deletion constructs of the gene promoter, LXR-\u03b1 activated the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter and the responsible region should be located from \u2212120 to \u2212102 bp. The exact sequence of the region is GAGCATCCCGGTTCCCGC, which does not match either canonical TRE or LXRE. We performed EMSAs employing various probes with different sequence in the region; however, LXR-\u03b1 or RXR-\u03b1/LXR-\u03b1 heterodimer did not bind to any probes. To examine LXR-\u03b1 recruitment in vivo, we tried to perform in vivo ChIP assays using mouse forebrain as we previously reported with liver [37], [41], [43], however, it did not work probably due to excessed lipid contents in the tissue. Therefore, alternatively we employed HTB185 cells to recapitulate physiological environment utilizing intrinsic nuclear receptors. Since HTB185 cells are derived from human medulloblastoma, we had to introduce the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter as described above. The ChIP assays demonstrated that LXR-\u03b1 was clearly recruited to the region from \u2212226 to +21 bp. Even though RXR-\u03b1 was also recruited to the region, it remains unclear whether LXR-\u03b1 recruitment requires RXR-\u03b1 in the current study. Collectively, we speculated that LXR-\u03b1 is recruited to the region without DNA binding. Since site 2 is located upstream of the region from \u2212120 to \u2212102 bp, TR-\u03b2 and LXR-\u03b1 do not share the same response element in the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter. The ChIP assays also demonstrated that LXR-\u03b1 recruitment was deteriorated upon TH administration indicating that in thyrotoxic state, LXR-\u03b1 could not induce the gene promoter. On the basis of these several lines of evidence, we speculate that in a thyrotoxic state, TR-\u03b2 binds to site 2 and regulates Seladin-1 gene expression; on the other hand, LXR-\u03b1 may functionally compensate for TR-\u03b2 being recruited to the region from \u2212120 to \u2212102 bp under hypothyroid state or in the presence of mutant TR-\u03b2 to maintain Seladin-1 gene expression (Figure 9). In hypothyroid status, co-repressors such as NCoR and SMRT [60], [61] are hard to dissociate from TR-\u03b2 because of lack of T3. Co-repressors are tethered to TR-\u03b2 \u0394337T mutant, which TRKI mice harbor, because of total deficiency of ligand binding of the mutant receptor. Indeed, NCoR binds to both TR-\u03b2 and LXR-\u03b1 and is a key regulator of TR and LXR target genes [62]. Therefore, considering the data obtained from analysis of TRKI mice and luciferase assay using TR-\u03b2 \u0394337T mutant, we hypothesize that in hypothyroid state and in RTH, co-repressors should be tethered to TR-\u03b2 in a squelching fashion and LXR-\u03b1 are relatively free from co-repressors, which enables to activate the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter upon administration of the LXR specific ligand.thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 9. Schematic diagram illustrating the hypothetical mechanism of TR and LXR crosstalk on the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054901.g009 Nowadays, the concept of subclinical hypothyroidism is widely accepted [63], [64], and it is assumed that AD patients with subclinical hypothyroidism could be increasing in number. On the basis of the data in the current study, for these patients, LXR agonists could be applicable as novel molecular therapeutic agents against AD since LXR compensates Seladin-1 gene expression under hypothyroid status.In conclusion, mouse Seladin-1 gene expression is positively regulated by TR-\u03b2 and LXR-\u03b1 at the transcriptional level and LXR-\u03b1 compensates the gene expression in hypothyroidism and RTH. Thus, we have, for the first time, demonstrated TR/LXR crosstalk on the Seladin-1 gene promoter in the mouse forebrain. We believe that further analysis of the crosstalk could shed light on the role of TH and LXR agonist against AD.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Prof. Fredric E.

Up-regulation of Seladin-1 reduces the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid and neuronal death. Thyroid hormone (TH) exerts an important effect on the development and maintenance of central nervous systems. In the current study, we demonstrated that Seladin-1 gene and protein expression in the forebrain was increased in thyrotoxic mice compared with that of euthyroid mice. However, unexpectedly, no significant decrease in the gene and protein expression was observed in hypothyroid mice. Interestingly, an agonist of liver X receptor (LXR), TO901317 (TO) administration in vivo increased Seladin-1 gene and protein expression in the mouse forebrain only in a hypothyroid state and in the presence of mutant TR-\u03b2, suggesting that LXR-\u03b1 would compensate for TR-\u03b2 function to maintain Seladin-1 gene expression in hypothyroidism and resistance to TH. TH activated the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (\u22121936/+21 bp) and site 2 including canonical TH response element (TRE) half-site in the region between \u2212159 and \u2212154 bp is responsible for the positive regulation. RXR-\u03b1/TR-\u03b2 heterodimerization was identified on site 2 by gel-shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed the recruitment of TR-\u03b2 to site 2 and the recruitment was increased upon TH administration. On the other hand, LXR-\u03b1 utilizes a distinct region from site 2 (\u2212120 to \u2212102 bp) to activate the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter. Taking these findings together, we concluded that TH up-regulates Seladin-1 gene expression at the transcriptional level and LXR-\u03b1 maintains the gene expression.Citation: Ishida E, Hashimoto K, Okada S, Satoh T, Yamada M, et al.

However, the pathogenesis of the disease has not yet been revealed.Thyroid hormone (TH) is well known to play an important role in the development and maintenance of the central nervous system in mammals [3], [4]. TH exerts its biological function through thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). TRs are nuclear hormone receptors, to which triiodothyronine (T3) binds at a high-affinity order as a native ligand. TRs possess at least two isoforms, TR-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 (Nr1a1 and Nr1a2), and several isoforms exist as two or three subtypes, respectively (\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21, \u03b22, and \u03b23) [5]. It is of note that only TR-\u03b11, \u03b21 and \u03b22 have both a ligand binding and a DNA binding domain [6]. TR-\u03b11 is widely expressed in tissues including heart, muscle, intestine, bone, and brain and plays a key role in regulating postnatal development and cardiac metabolism, whereas TR-\u03b21 is also widely expressed in brain, cochlea, pituitary, kidney, lung, heart and at its highest level in the liver regulating multiple steps in hepatic metabolism as well as thyroid hormone levels [6]. TR-\u03b22 expression is mainly in the pituitary, the hypothalamic TRH neurons, the developing inner ear and retina [7]. Thus, both TR-\u03b1 and TR-\u03b2 play an important role for the development and the maintenance of the central nervous system even though their expression patterns are spatiotemporally distinct [8]\u2013[10]. Hypothyroidism sometimes leads to the development of dementia-like symptoms, especially in elderly patients [11], [12]. The TH receptor (TR) \u03b2-\u0394337T knock-in (TRKI) mouse demonstrates severe cerebellar ataxia and cognitive dysfunction [13]. As such, although case reports and basic studies support the idea that TH is closely related to AD pathogenesis and could be beneficial to cure AD [14]\u2013[16], large-scale clinical studies examining the relationship between thyroid function and AD have led to controversial conclusions [17]\u2013[20].Among many genes related to AD, we focused on selective AD indicator 1, Seladin-1 gene. Seladin-1 gene expression is down-regulated in the vulnerable region in the brain of AD patients [21]. Up-regulation of Seladin-1 in the neuron leads to the reduction of \u03b2-amyloid accumulation and apoptosis [21]\u2013[23]. Seladin-1 gene codes 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), which catalyzes the final step of cholesterol synthesis [24]. Cholesterol inside the neuron inhibits co-localization of \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE), protecting \u03b2-amyloid accumulation [22], [25]. Thus, cholesterol in the neuron is responsible for maintenance of neural function [25]. Seladin-1 protects the neuron by increasing the intracellular cholesterol synthesis [21], [22], [26]. In a previous report, TH administration to some neuronal precursor cell lines induced Seladin-1 gene expression [27]. However, the molecular mechanism by which TH up-regulates Seladin-1 mRNA levels is yet to be elucidated.Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear oxysterol receptors and play pivotal roles in cholesterol metabolism [28], [29]. LXRs comprise two isoforms, LXR-\u03b1 and -\u03b2. Both isoforms are expressed in the brain, although the latter is expressed at significantly higher levels [30]. An artificial agonist of LXR, TO901317 (TO), reduces \u03b2-amyloid accumulation and AD-specific pathological changes in the brain of an AD model mouse [31]\u2013[33]. Since LXR response element (LXRE) is identified in the second intron in human Seladin-1 gene promoter, another group has suggested that Seladin-1 gene promoter may be a target of LXR [34]. However, the molecular mechanism by which LXRs regulate Seladin-1 gene expression has been yet to be elucidated.TRs and LXRs are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Although LXRs and TRs belong to two distinct receptor subgroups with respect to ligand-binding affinity [35], the two receptor systems show similarity with respect to molecular mechanism, target genes, and physiological roles [36]. Since both TRs and LXRs play an important role in metabolic regulation, form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs), and bind to direct repeat-4 (DR-4) with identical geometry and polarity [28], [36]\u2013[38], crosstalk between the two receptors has been reported, especially on lipid metabolism-related genes [37]\u2013[43].In the current study, we demonstrate that TH increased Seladin-1 gene and protein expression in the mouse forebrain. However, no significant difference between euthyroid and hypothyroid mice was observed. Interestingly, TO administration in vivo increased Seladin-1 gene and protein expression in the mouse forebrain only in a hypothyroid state and in the presence of mutant TR-\u03b2. We also show that TH activates mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter and identify a novel positive thyroid hormone response element named site 2 including canonical thyroid hormone response element (TRE) half-site in the mouse promoter. Taking these findings together, we concluded that TH up-regulates Seladin-1 gene expression at the transcriptional level and that LXR-\u03b1 would compensate for TR-\u03b2 function to maintain Seladin-1 gene expression in hypothyroidism and resistance to TH (RTH). Thus, our data strongly suggests that TR and LXR crosstalk in Seladin-1 gene regulation.Materials and MethodsAnimals8 to 12-week-old male C57/BL6 (B6) and TRKI mice (generously provided by Prof. Fredric E. Wondisford, Johns Hopkins medical institute, Baltimore) were employed for the study. All aspects of animal care were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine (Maebashi, Gunma, Japan, Protocol number #10-059). Animals were maintained on a 12 h light/12 h dark schedule (lights on at 06:00 h) and fed laboratory chow as indicated and given water ad libitum. Hypothyroidism was induced in the B6 mice by the inclusion of 0.1% methimazole (MMI) in the drinking water and 1% (w/w) propylthiouracil (PTU) in the chow for 21 days [37], [41]. To induce a thyrotoxic state, the B6 mice were injected daily with 10 \u00b5g per 20 g body weight of T3 for 7 days [37]. For TO treatment, 1 mg per 20 g body weight of TO901317 (#71810 Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI) was intraperitoneally administered daily for 7 days [31], [33] or vehicle (DMSO) was administered for Sham group. The number of mice receiving each treatment is indicated in the figures. Serum-free T3 and T4 levels were measured by SRL (Tokyo, Japan). We anatomically excised cerebellum, diencephalon, pituitary, hypothalamus, and medulla oblongata from the whole brain of mouse and obtained the rest as forebrain for the analysis as we reported previously [13].PlasmidsThe mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (\u22121936/+21 bp) plasmid, which contained the region from \u22121936 to +21 bp of the mouse Seladin-1 gene, was generated by genomic PCR using 5\u2032-GTGTGGTACCTGGTGGCAGGAGAGAGCCCC-3\u2032 as a sense primer and 5\u2032-GTGTAGATCTGTAAGTCGGGCCCGCCGCC-3\u2032 as an anti-sense primer. An Asp718 or BglII restriction enzyme site was introduced into each primer sequence so that the PCR product could be subcloned between these sites in the pGL4-Luc vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The deletion mutants and a site 1 or site 2 point mutants were generated with PCR site-directed mutagenesis [37], [43], [44]. All human TR-\u03b21 and its mutants, human TR-\u03b11, RXR-\u03b1, murine LXR-\u03b1, and LXR-\u03b2 cDNAs were placed into an SV40 expression construct, pSG5 [44]. All PCR-generated constructs were verified by sequencing the DNA.Transfections and Luciferase AssayFor the luciferase assay, we employed CV-1 cells. 10 \u00b5g of the reporter plasmid and 0.25 \u00b5g of human TR-\u03b21 or TR-\u03b11 or mouse LXR-\u03b11 or LXR-\u03b2 in pSG5 was transfected per plate of a 6-well format into CV-1 cells using the calcium-phosphate method. Sixteen hours after transfection, cultures were treated with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) containing 10% resin charcoal double-stripped fetal bovine serum for 8 hours in the absence or presence of 10\u22128 M T3 or 10\u22126 M TO. All transfections were equalized for the same total amount of expression vector using an empty vector as needed. We performed \u03b2-gal assays to confirm the transfection efficiency of the luciferase assay for each experiment at least once and found no significant difference in transfection efficiency among the plates. Data are presented as fold basal activation over vector (pSG5) in the absence of ligand stimulation \u00b1 SEM or as otherwise indicated. Luciferase activity is expressed as arbitrary light units per \u00b5g of cellular protein. All transfection experiments were repeated at least twice with triplicate determinations.Western BlottingFor analysis of the protein expression of Seladin-1 (DHCR24), 30 \u00b5g of whole cell extract from mouse forebrain was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed using a rabbit anti-DHCR24 polyclonal antibody (#ab40490, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) to detect Sealdin-1 protein levels and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (#ab8245, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) as a control. The Seladin-1 detects a specific band at 55 kDa in tissues and cells. The bands were quantitatively measured using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems Corp., San Jose, CA) and ImageJ (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/, 1997\u20132011). All Western blotting experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Seladin-1 protein levels are normalized by GAPDH. Data are presented as fold basal euthyroid (E) levels \u00b1 SEM or as otherwise indicated.RNA Preparation and Real-time Quantitative PCRTotal RNA was extracted from mouse forebrain using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). Real-time quantitative PCR assays were performed using an Applied Biosystems 7500 sequence detector with the standard 40 cycles. Briefly, 1 \u00b5g of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers using the TaqmanTM Reverse Transcription Reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Mouse Seladin-1 mRNA expression was analyzed using TaqmanTM probes (Mm00519071_m1, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). We set up a standard curve for each real-time PCR and confirmed that all PCR products were on the standard curve as we previously described [43]. The PCR results were normalized to mouse cyclophilin A expression using a TaqmanTM probe (Mm02342430_gl, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The number of samples is indicated in the figure legends.Gel-shift AssaysElectrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs, gel-shift assays) were performed as described previously [45]. Mouse LXR-\u03b1, human TR-\u03b21, and human RXR-\u03b1 recombinant proteins were synthesized from constructs in the pSG5 expression vector, using the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/ Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI). Binding reactions contained 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mM KCl, 12% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 \u00b5g of poly (dI-dC)(dI-dC), and 6 \u00b5l of each of the synthesized nuclear receptors or unprogrammed reticulocyte lysates. Double-stranded oligonucleotides (DR-4 for rat cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP7A1): 5\u2032- TGTTTGCTTTGGTCACTCAAGTTCAA-3\u2032, Site 1 probe ; 5\u2032- CTCCCACCCTGGGGAGGTTACCCAATGCACAACT-3\u2032, Site 2 probe ; 5\u2032- AGCGCCCCCAGCCCAGGTCAGCCCCTCCTCGCAC-3\u2032) were labeled with [\u03b1-32P] deoxy-CTP by a fill-in reaction using a Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min. For competition experiments, a 20- or 40-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotides was included. For supershift experiments, 3 \u00b5l of rabbit anti-TR-\u03b21 polyclonal antibody (06-539, Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) or mouse anti-LXR-\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (PP-PPZ0412-00, Perseus proteomics, Tokyo, Japan) was added and the mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5X TBE (45 mM Tris-base, 1 mM EDTA). All gel-shift assays were repeated at least three times with similar results and a representative result is shown.Small Interfering (si) RNA against LXRsWe employed Dharmacon\u2019s siRNA against human LXR-\u03b1 (L-003413-00-0005, ON-TARGET plus SMART pool, human NR1H3) and LXR-\u03b2 (L-003412-00-0005, ON-TARGET plus SMART pool, human NR1H2) (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). The target sequences of siRNA for human LXR-\u03b1 are as follows: 5\u2032-GAGUUUGCCUUGCUCAUUG-3\u2032; 5\u2032-CGACUGAUGUUCCCACGGA-3\u2032; 5\u2032-GAACAACUGGGCAUGAUCG-3\u2032; 5\u2032-CCUCAAGGAUUUCAGUUAU-3\u2032, and the target sequences for LXR-\u03b2 were as follows: 5\u2032-AACAGCGGCUCAAGAACUA-3\u2032; 5\u2032-CUAAGCAAGUGCCUGGUUU-3\u2032; 5\u2032-GAAGAAGAUUCGGAAACAG-3\u2032; 5\u2032-CAACCACGAGACAGAGUGU-3\u2032. SiRNA for the negative control (ON-TARGET plus Non-targeting pool, D-001810-10-20, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA) was employed. SiRNAs were transfected into HTB185 cells, derived from human medulloblastoma using the lipofection method (Lipofectamine RNAiMAX, Invitrogen). Briefly, in the 6-well format, 50 pmol of siRNAs against each LXR (\u03b1 or \u03b2) or 100 pmol of non-targeting siRNA per well were transfected into the HTB185 cells. Sixteen hours after transfection, cultures were treated with DMEM containing 10% resin charcoal double-stripped fetal bovine serum for 8 hours in the absence or presence of 10\u22126 M TO. After incubation, total RNA was extracted from the cells and real-time quantitative PCR assays were performed as described above. Human Seladin-1, LXR-\u03b1 and LXR-\u03b2 mRNA expression levels were analyzed using TaqmanTM probes (Hs00207388_m1, Hs00172885_m1 and Hs00173195_m1, respectively. Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) AssayChIP assays were performed using a kit (ChIP-ITTM Express) from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s protocol with some modifications. Briefly, in prior to ChIP assays, the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (\u22121113/+21 bp) in pGL4 was transfected into the HTB185 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The transfected HTB185 cells were incubated in medium containing 10% resin-charcoal double-stripped fetal bovine serum with or without 10\u22128 M T3. After incubation, formaldehyde (37%) was directly added to the culture at a final concentration of 1% and the cells were incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C to crosslink protein to DNA. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 600 \u00b5l of lysis buffer supplemented with 3 \u00b5l of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PIC) and 0.5 mM PMSF and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. The resuspended cells were passed through a 27G syringe 10 times to aid nucleus release. The nucleus pellet was resuspended in 210 \u00b5l of Shearing Buffer (supplemented with 1.05 \u00b5l of PIC) and the samples were placed on ice. The nucleus lysate was sonicated 4 times with 10-sec pulses using a sonicator set at 50% of maximum power to reduce DNA length to between 200 and 1000 bp. Sheared chromatin solution (50 \u00b5l) was used for each ChIP assay with 2 \u00b5g of a mouse anti-TR-\u03b2 monoclonal antibody (PP-H3825A-00, Perseus proteomics, Tokyo, Japan), mouse anti-LXR-\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (PP-K8607-00, Perseus proteomics, Tokyo, Japan) and rabbit anti-RXR-\u03b1 polyclonal antibody (sc-774, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). As a negative control, normal rabbit IgG (#2729, Cell Signaling Technology, Denver, CO) was used. For Ct value-based evaluation of ChIP results, quantitative PCR was performed with power SYBR Green (#4367659, Applied Biosystems) in Applied Biosystems 7500 sequence detector by using 1 \u00b5l of immunoprecipitate or input according to the manufacturer\u2019s specified parameters. The primers used for the region between \u2212226 bp and +21 bp for quantitative PCR were as follows: forward 5\u2032-CTCCAGAGCGAGAGCCCTAA-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-GTAAGTCGGGCCCGCCGCCT-3\u2032. The predicted PCR product was 247 bp long. The values were corrected using the input values and presented as %input \u00b1 SEM. All ChIP assays were repeated at least twice with triplicate determinations.Statistical AnalysesStatistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and parametric Welch\u2019s t-test or nonparametric Mann-Whitney test [46], [47] where appropriate to assess statistical differences between means with Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) and JMP (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Values are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM).ResultsT3 Up-regulates Seladin-1 Gene Expression in the Mouse ForebrainTo examine whether TH regulates mouse Seladin-1 gene expression, we performed real-time RT-PCR using mouse forebrain steady-state total RNA. For this purpose, we first rendered the B6 mice in a hypothyroid state (H) with an MMI/PTU diet, or made them thyrotoxic (T) with T3 administration intraperitoneally (Figure 1A, 1B). TH levels (free T4 and free T3) are shown in Table 1. As shown in Figure 1A, when T3 was administered to 8- to 12-week-old B6 mice intraperitoneally, Seladin-1 gene expression levels in the forebrain were increased about 2.5-fold. Unexpectedly, mice in a hypothyroid state did not show significant down-regulation of Seladin-1 gene compared to the control. We obtained a similar result for protein expression levels (Figure 1B).thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 1.

E: euthyroid basal status (control). The number of mice involved in each treatment is indicated in the figures. Forebrain total RNA was isolated and one microgram of total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription (RT). RT real-time PCR analysis for Seladin-1 was performed using mouse forebrain cDNA (A).

Free T4 and free T3 levels in each thyroid state.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054901.t001 TO Up-regulates Seladin-1 Gene Expression in the Mouse Forebrain Under Hypothyroid Status and in the Forebrain of TRKI MiceBased on the data that hypothyroid treatment did not reduce Seladin-1 gene expression, from a perspective of TR-LXR crosstalk as previously reported [5], [37], [48], we speculated that LXR would compensate to maintain the gene expression under hypothyroid status. Unexpectedly, as shown in Figure 2A, TO did not change Seladin-1 gene expression levels in the forebrain of B6 mice in the basal status. However, in a hypothyroid state, TO increased Seladin-1 gene expression levels in the forebrain (by 2.1 fold, Figure 2C). We obtained a similar result for protein expression levels (Figure 2B, 2D). As previously reported [41], free T4 levels of TRKI mice (homozygous mice), which demonstrates severe thyroid dysfunction were extremely high (over 7.77 ng/dl) because of RTH (data not shown). However, Seladin-1 mRNA and protein levels in the forebrain of TRKI mice were comparable to those of wild-type (WT) mice (Figure 3A, 3B). On the other hand, as shown in Figure 3C, administration of TO significantly increased Seladin-1 gene expression in the forebrain of TRKI mice compared with that of Sham group about 1.2-fold. We obtained a similar result for protein expression levels (Figure 3D). These lines of evidence supported our hypothesis; LXRs compensate to maintain Seladin-1 gene expression in hypothyroidism and/or in TR-\u03b2 dysfunction.thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 2.

We employed this reporter construct and performed luciferase assays with CV-1 cells, which are known to be deficient for endogenous TRs [45]. When we co-transfected the gene promoter (\u22121936/+21 bp) with TR-\u03b21 into CV-1 cells, T3 significantly activated the promoter activity, however the up-regulation was not observed with co-transfection of TR-\u03b11 (Figure 4A). These data indicated that TH activates mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter via TR-\u03b2. Next, we prepared a series of deletion constructs of the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (Figure 4B), which were subjected to transfection into CV-1 cells with these reporters together with TR-\u03b21. As shown in Figure 4C, the \u2212136/+21 construct was not activated by T3. We identified two TRE half-sites, one is located from \u2212304 to \u2212299 bp and the other one is located from \u2212159 to \u2212154 bp in the mouse Seladin-1 promoter and hypothesized that these TRE half site regions could be a novel positive TRE. We referred to the upstream and downstream region as site 1 and 2, respectively. We introduced mutation into the TRE half-site in site 1 and 2 in the context of the \u22121936/+21 reporter (Figure 4D, upper panel). As shown in Figure 4E, lower panel, the positive regulation by T3 deteriorated in the mutt 2 reporter, indicating that the TRE half-site in site 2 is functionally important.thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 4.

NS: not significant.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054901.g004 TR-\u03b21 DNA Binding is Essential for Positive Regulation of Mouse Seladin-1 Gene PromoterWe co-transfected several types of mutant TR-\u03b21 and the \u22121936/+21 reporter into CV-1 cells. As shown in Figure 4F, GS125, a DNA binding mutant [49], \u0394337T, a ligand binding mutant [50], [51], and R427Q [51], [52], a heterodimerization mutant with RXR-\u03b1, did not activate the promoter, whereas E457A, a co-activator binding mutant [53], positively regulated mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter activity as wild-type TR-\u03b21. These data suggest that ligand binding, TR-\u03b21 DNA binding, and heterodimerization with RXR-\u03b1 are required for the positive regulation.RXR-\u03b1/TR-\u03b21 Heterodimer Binds to Site 2Since we found that site 2 is functionally important for the positive regulation of the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter based on the reporter assay data (Figure 4E), we hypothesized that TR-\u03b21 could bind to site 2 in the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter. To investigate this, we employed oligonucleotides for site 1, encompassing \u2212318 to \u2212285 bp and for site 2, from \u2212173 to \u2212140 bp in the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter, including the TRE consensus half-site motif. We performed electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs) with the radiolabeled site 1 and 2 probes (Figure 5A). As shown in Figure 5B, it was revealed that RXR-\u03b1/TR-\u03b21 heterodimer bound to site 2 but not to site 1. Anti-TR-\u03b2 antibody shifted the heterodimer band, indicating that the binding was TR-\u03b2-specific. In addition, either RXR-\u03b1/TR-\u03b11 heterodimer or TR-\u03b11 homodyne did not bind to site 2 (data not shown).thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 5.

As shown in Figure 6A, TO significantly increased human Seladin-1 gene expression about 1.5 fold (left graph). In addition, induction of siRNA against LXR-\u03b1/\u03b2 into HTB185 cells revealed that TO did not increase the gene expression in LXRs knockdown-HTB185 cells (Figure 6A, right graph). These data indicate that TO increases Seladin-1 gene expression in HTB185 cells through intrinsic LXRs. We confirmed LXR-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 gene expression levels in the HTB 185 cells, which siRNA against LXR-\u03b1/\u03b2 was induced (Figure 6B). It revealed that both LXR isoform gene expression levels were significantly reduced in the LXRs knockdown cells. In addition, TO induced the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (\u22121936/+21 bp) in CV-1 cells in the presence of LXR-\u03b1 or LXR-\u03b2 indicating that both isoforms potentiate to activate the gene promoter upon TO administration (Figure 6C). However, as shown in Figure 6B, since the gene expression of LXR-\u03b1 was robust compared to that of LXR-\u03b2, we concluded that LXR-\u03b1 is the dominant isoform in HTB185 cells. Thus, we employed LXR-\u03b1 for further analysis of the up-regulation of mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter by TO.thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 6.

An analysis of deletion constructs of the gene promoter revealed that the \u2212102/+21 construct was not activated by TO indicating that the region from \u2212120 to \u2212102 bp but not site 2 is responsible for the positive regulation (Figure 7A). Moreover, EMSA demonstrated that LXR-\u03b1 or RXR-\u03b1/LXR-\u03b1 heterodimer did not bind to site 2 (Figure 7B). We performed EMSA employing several probes with different sequence including the region from \u2212120 to \u2212102 bp; however, LXR-\u03b1 or RXR-\u03b1/LXR-\u03b1 heterodimer did not bind to any probes (data not shown).thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 7.

We introduced the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (\u22121113 to +21 bp) in HTB185 cells by transient transfection. As shown in Figure 8B, in HTB185 cells, the recruitment of intrinsic TR-\u03b2 to the \u2212226 to +21 bp region significantly increased upon T3 administration. Since the set of PCR primer covers the region from \u2212120 to \u2212102 bp, with which LXR-\u03b1 should interact, LXR-\u03b1 recruitment to the region was observed in the absence of TH, but TH significantly reduced the recruitment.thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 8.

NS: not significant.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054901.g008 DiscussionIn the current study, we demonstrated that mouse Seladin-1 mRNA and protein levels in forebrain were up-regulated by TH administration in vivo. We have obtained some controversial results from the in vivo study. While Seladin-1 gene expression is induced in a thyrotoxic state, under hypothyroid treatment, the gene and protein expression levels were not significantly reduced compared to those in a euthyroid state (Figure 1). Moreover, no significant differences in the gene expression between wild-type and TRKI mice, which was expected to recapitulate hypothyroid state in the forebrain, were found (Figure 3A and 3B). This in vivo data indicated a compensation to maintain the gene expression should exist. First, we tried to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which TH up-regulates the gene expression and we demonstrated that the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter was activated by T3 in CV-1 cells. Benvenuti et al. reported that TH up-regulates the Seladin-1 gene expression in in vitro model of human neuronal precursor cell lines [27]. They conformed that TR-\u03b11, TR-\u03b21 and TR-\u03b22 genes were expressed in these neuronal precursor cell lines, however it was unclear whether the up-regulation of the Seladin-1 gene expression by T3 was isoform specific. It is well known that both TR-\u03b1 and TR-\u03b2 are important for the development and maintenance of central nervous system in mammals and other species [7]\u2013[10], [54]. Thus, we examined the activation of the Seladin-1 gene promoter by T3 could be TR isoform specific and found that TR-\u03b2 but not TR-\u03b1 is responsible for the positive regulation (Figure 4A). The gene promoter investigated in the current study contains two consensus TRE-half sites; site 1 and 2. Through the analysis of deletion mutant promoters and EMSAs, we have identified site 2 as a novel positive TRE. Estrogen receptor (ER) is another nuclear receptor closely related to Seladin-1 gene expression. Estrogens are well known to exert neurotropic and neuroprotective effects in vitro [55], [56] and increase Seladin-1 gene expression in fetal neuroepithelial cells [57]. Similar to site 2 for TR, half-palindromic estrogen response element (ERE) in Seladin-1 gene promoter is functionally responsible for the promoter activation by ER [58].The ChIP assays using HTB185 cells revealed that TR-\u03b2 is recruited to site 2 flanking region and that the recruitment is augmented upon T3 administration. Generally, TR-\u03b2 as a type 2 nuclear receptor should constitutively bind to DNA in the gene promoter in the presence or absence of T3; however, recently, Liu et al. reported that TR-\u03b2 was recruited to the TRE in a T3-dose-dependent manner in a time-course study [59]. Our data regarding TR-\u03b2 recruitment is congruent with this report by Liu et al. The study employing several types of TR-\u03b2 mutant revealed that the positive regulation of the promoter by TR-\u03b2 required ligand binding, DNA binding, and heterodimerization with RXR-\u03b1, and that co-activator binding does not seem to be necessarily required for the regulation (Figure 4F).Crosstalk between TR-\u03b2 and LXR-\u03b1 has been reported, especially on lipid metabolism-related genes. Recently, several types of crosstalk between TRs and LXRs have been identified and crosstalk has also been observed in other physiological systems such as central nervous system other than lipid metabolism [5], [41], [48]. Therefore, we hypothesized that LXR-\u03b1 could compensate to maintain mouse Seladin-1 gene expression in hypothyroid status and in the TRKI mice. Supporting our hypothesis, TO, an artificial agonist of LXRs, induced the gene expression in a hypothyroid state (Figure 2C, 2D) and in TRKI mice (Figure 3C, 3D), but not in euthyroid state (Figure 2A, 2B). Since TO clearly increased Seladin-1 gene expression in HTB185 cells through intrinsic LXRs and induced the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter activity in CV-1 cells, Seladin-1 is considered as an LXR target gene. Wang et al. reported that Seladin-1 gene expression in the brain of LXR-\u03b2 knockout mice was not decreased compared to that of wild-type mice [34]. We speculate that it is due to that TR-\u03b2 dominantly regulates Seladin-1 gene expression in mice. Another speculation is that LXR-\u03b2 could not be required for the regulation of mouse Seladin-1 gene in forebrain.We demonstrated that LXR-\u03b1 is a dominant isoform in HTB185 cells, in which Seladin-1 gene expression was positively regulated by TO (Figure 6), therefore we employed LXR-\u03b1 to elucidate a molecular mechanism for the positive regulation of the gene. Based on the data obtained by the analysis of deletion constructs of the gene promoter, LXR-\u03b1 activated the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter and the responsible region should be located from \u2212120 to \u2212102 bp. The exact sequence of the region is GAGCATCCCGGTTCCCGC, which does not match either canonical TRE or LXRE. We performed EMSAs employing various probes with different sequence in the region; however, LXR-\u03b1 or RXR-\u03b1/LXR-\u03b1 heterodimer did not bind to any probes. To examine LXR-\u03b1 recruitment in vivo, we tried to perform in vivo ChIP assays using mouse forebrain as we previously reported with liver [37], [41], [43], however, it did not work probably due to excessed lipid contents in the tissue. Therefore, alternatively we employed HTB185 cells to recapitulate physiological environment utilizing intrinsic nuclear receptors. Since HTB185 cells are derived from human medulloblastoma, we had to introduce the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter as described above. The ChIP assays demonstrated that LXR-\u03b1 was clearly recruited to the region from \u2212226 to +21 bp. Even though RXR-\u03b1 was also recruited to the region, it remains unclear whether LXR-\u03b1 recruitment requires RXR-\u03b1 in the current study. Collectively, we speculated that LXR-\u03b1 is recruited to the region without DNA binding. Since site 2 is located upstream of the region from \u2212120 to \u2212102 bp, TR-\u03b2 and LXR-\u03b1 do not share the same response element in the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter. The ChIP assays also demonstrated that LXR-\u03b1 recruitment was deteriorated upon TH administration indicating that in thyrotoxic state, LXR-\u03b1 could not induce the gene promoter. On the basis of these several lines of evidence, we speculate that in a thyrotoxic state, TR-\u03b2 binds to site 2 and regulates Seladin-1 gene expression; on the other hand, LXR-\u03b1 may functionally compensate for TR-\u03b2 being recruited to the region from \u2212120 to \u2212102 bp under hypothyroid state or in the presence of mutant TR-\u03b2 to maintain Seladin-1 gene expression (Figure 9). In hypothyroid status, co-repressors such as NCoR and SMRT [60], [61] are hard to dissociate from TR-\u03b2 because of lack of T3. Co-repressors are tethered to TR-\u03b2 \u0394337T mutant, which TRKI mice harbor, because of total deficiency of ligand binding of the mutant receptor. Indeed, NCoR binds to both TR-\u03b2 and LXR-\u03b1 and is a key regulator of TR and LXR target genes [62]. Therefore, considering the data obtained from analysis of TRKI mice and luciferase assay using TR-\u03b2 \u0394337T mutant, we hypothesize that in hypothyroid state and in RTH, co-repressors should be tethered to TR-\u03b2 in a squelching fashion and LXR-\u03b1 are relatively free from co-repressors, which enables to activate the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter upon administration of the LXR specific ligand.thumbnailDownload: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image () TIFF original image () Figure 9. Schematic diagram illustrating the hypothetical mechanism of TR and LXR crosstalk on the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0054901.g009 Nowadays, the concept of subclinical hypothyroidism is widely accepted [63], [64], and it is assumed that AD patients with subclinical hypothyroidism could be increasing in number. On the basis of the data in the current study, for these patients, LXR agonists could be applicable as novel molecular therapeutic agents against AD since LXR compensates Seladin-1 gene expression under hypothyroid status.In conclusion, mouse Seladin-1 gene expression is positively regulated by TR-\u03b2 and LXR-\u03b1 at the transcriptional level and LXR-\u03b1 compensates the gene expression in hypothyroidism and RTH. Thus, we have, for the first time, demonstrated TR/LXR crosstalk on the Seladin-1 gene promoter in the mouse forebrain. We believe that further analysis of the crosstalk could shed light on the role of TH and LXR agonist against AD.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Prof. Fredric E.

Formula display:\ufffcAbstractBackgroundAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is intimately tied to amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide. Extraneuronal brain plaques consisting primarily of A\u03b2 aggregates are a hallmark of AD. Intraneuronal A\u03b2 subunits are strongly implicated in disease progression. Protein sequence mutations of the A\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) account for a small proportion of AD cases, suggesting that regulation of the associated gene (APP) may play a more important role in AD etiology. The APP promoter possesses a novel 30 nucleotide sequence, or \u201cproximal regulatory element\u201d (PRE), at \u221276/\u221247, from the +1 transcription start site that confers cell type specificity. This PRE contains sequences that make it vulnerable to epigenetic modification and may present a viable target for drug studies. We examined PRE-nuclear protein interaction by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and PRE mutant EMSA. This was followed by functional studies of PRE mutant/reporter gene fusion clones. ResultsEMSA probed with the PRE showed DNA-protein interaction in multiple nuclear extracts and in human brain tissue nuclear extract in a tissue-type specific manner. We identified transcription factors that are likely to bind the PRE, using competition gel shift and gel supershift: Activator protein 2 (AP2), nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase/metastatic inhibitory protein (PuF), and specificity protein 1 (SP1). These sites crossed a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). EMSA with PRE mutants and promoter/reporter clone transfection analysis further implicated PuF in cells and extracts. Functional assays of mutant/reporter clone transfections were evaluated by ELISA of reporter protein levels. EMSA and ELISA results correlated by meta-analysis. ConclusionsWe propose that PuF may regulate the APP gene promoter and that AD risk may be increased by interference with PuF regulation at the PRE. PuF is targeted by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1, which also interacts with the integrins. These proteins are connected to vital cellular and neurological functions. In addition, the transcription factor PuF is a known inhibitor of metastasis and regulates cell growth during development. Given that APP is a known cell adhesion protein and ferroxidase, this suggests biochemical links among cell signaling, the cell cycle, iron metabolism in cancer, and AD in the context of overall aging.

In addition, intracellular A\u03b2 has been implicated as having a pathological role in AD and Down syndrome [3], and A\u03b2 may function as a transcription factor (TF) [4,5]. A\u03b2 is cleaved from a larger precursor protein (APP) by a process involving two secretase enzymes, \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase [2]. Hyperphosphorylated \u03c4 protein and \u03b1-synuclein also have a likely role in AD etiology [6-8], and apolipoprotein E (APOE) is linked to a large proportion of cases of AD both by genetic [9,10] and cholesterol-related functional studies [11]. We hypothesize that unusually high production of A\u03b2 significantly contributes to AD, and this aberrant A\u03b2 production can result from unusually high APP gene (APP) expression, particularly in a tissue and cell-type specific manner. Several groups have studied the 5\u2032-flanking region of the APP gene, including its promoter [12-16]. Serial deletion analysis has shown that the APP promoter [14,17] and 5\u2032-UTR [18] contain several regulatory elements that are likely to modulate transcriptional activity. In addition to proximal regulatory regions, two upstream sequences have been identified that regulate the gene\u2019s expression [14], including one that has been shown to generally stimulate APP production [19]. The APP promoter is regulated by a variety of factors. It can be stimulated by nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin-l [20,21], and copper depletion downregulates its activity [22]. A link between APP gene regulation and pathologies such as AD has been shown, for example, by characterization of two APP promoter polymorphisms associated with the pathogenesis of some forms of AD [23]. The more upstream of these two polymorphic sites may function as a target site for A\u03b2 acting as a transcription factor [4,5]. Our group has examined regulatory regions of important AD-associated genes, including APOE[24,25] and microtubule-associated protein \u03c4 (MAPT) [26]. We have also previously characterized a deletion series of the APP promoter in eight different cell lines from five different tissue types in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter construct [27]. We discovered that a novel 30 nucleotide (nt) sequence of \u221276 to \u221247 from the +1 transcription start site (TSS) had differential effect depending upon cell line. In human kidney epithelial cells, deletion of this element resulted in 50-fold reduction of CAT reporter gene activity. In human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma (NB) cells, deletion resulted in a 3 to 4-fold gain of reporter gene activity, the greatest NB cell expression for all clones of the deletion series. We thus termed this region the \u201cproximal regulatory element\u201d (PRE) of the APP gene. We examined the nature of DNA-protein interaction with this DNA fragment by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA or gel shift). Notably, use of the PRE as a probe in EMSA showed evidence of DNA-protein interaction with this sequence in multiple cell line nuclear extracts and in mouse brain tissue nuclear extract [27]. However, the specific nature of nuclear proteins that interact with the PRE in different cell types was not determined at that time. We continue our work on the PRE by exploring specific DNA-protein interactions in EMSA, competition EMSA, and antibody-supershift EMSA. Functional effects were measured by creation of a library of mutant PRE sequences within a previously constructed [17]APP-CAT fusion clone. While we had previously shown that the PRE interacts with nuclear proteins in a tissue-type specific manner, we herein identified TFs that were likely bind to the PRE, specifically activator protein 2 (AP2), nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase/metastatic inhibitory protein (PuF), and specificity protein 1 (SP1). We also characterized quantitative and qualitative effects of mutating the PRE vs. DNA-protein interaction in EMSA vs. both NB and rat neuronal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and cell nuclear extracts. Functional assays of PRE mutation effects were performed by transiently transfecting the mutant-CAT clones into human neuroblastoma and rat neuronal pheochromocytoma cell cultures. We discovered specific, significant mutation-dependent function differences. We compared the EMSA results to effects of the same mutations in functional mutant-CAT clone transfection assays. Altering the PRE\u2019s ability to bind TF corresponded to functional changes in promoter activity in a cell line-specific manner. We determined that PuF and SP1 are candidates for regulation of the APP gene through the PRE. PuF\u2019s better-known function is as an inhibitor of metastasis [28]. SP1 activity in APP regulation has already been well demonstrated [29-33]. SP1 sites have been located in both the promoter [13,32,34] and 5\u2032-UTR portions of the APP 5\u2032-flanking region [35,36]. Our data led us to propose that SP1 and PuF act antagonistically through the PRE, with SP1 stimulating and PuF repressing APP transcription. These two TF sites can be subject to natural variation in the human genome, as they cross a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [37]. The PRE sequence contains sites for DNA methylation and oxidation, suggesting the site may be vulnerable to environmentally-mediated epigenetic modification. Should such interference with PuF regulation of APP increase risk of AD, it would be another similarity between etiology of sporadic/idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders and oncogenesis, extending our previous work in developing the latent early-life associated regulation (LEARn) model [38,39] of idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders. ResultsPutative transcription factor sites within the PREThe PRE with an additional 10nt flanking sequence at either end was used with TESS [40] and MatInspector [41] to probe the TransFac database [42]. Restricting predicted sites to mammal TF matrices and eliminating redundant sites resulted in predicted affinities with several transcription factors (Table 1), including AP2, GATA binding proteins 1 (GATA1) and 2 (GATA2), two GC boxes, paired box gene 4-a (Pax4a), PuF, Epstein-Barr virus transcription factor R (R), SP1, and transcription elongation regulator 1 (mammal homologue to zeste, TCERG1). Truncated upstream stimulatory factor (USF)1 and USF2 sites were also found at the 3\u2032-end of the PRE. The GC box is associated with the binding of several transcription factors, including SP1, basic transcription element binding protein (BTEB)1, BTEB2, and msh homeobox 1 (Msx1). Table 1. Predicted TF sites in the PREDNA-protein interaction of the PRE by EMSA varies among tissue types and cell line conditions To investigate cell type specificity of PRE-protein interactions, we used the PRE fragment in EMSA with nuclear extracts from PC12 and human cervical epithelial (HeLa), SK-N-BE neuroblastoma (NB), and histiocytic lymphoma (U937) cells (Figure 1A\u2013C) and with nuclear extracts from human tissues (Figure 1D). PC12 extracts (Figure 1A) were obtained from both normal and hypoxic cells (lanes 1\u20132). U937 extracts (Figure 1A) included nuclei from untreated cells and from cells treated with interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or TPA + IFN-\u03b3 (lanes 3\u20137). In addition, to test specificity of PRE binding with untreated U937 extracts, we also competed the PRE/U937 EMSA against 200x molar excess unlabeled PRE fragment (lane 5). Nuclear extract EMSA showed definite interaction between the PRE and both PC12 and U937 extracts. This interaction was competed away with excess PRE in U937 extracts. DNA-protein interactions could be altered by specific treatment of cells from which extracts were taken. Hypoxia greatly reduced the observed interaction in PC12 extracts (lane 2). Treatment with the cytokine IFN-\u03b3 may have slightly increased interaction in U937 extracts (lane 4), but TPA treatment seems to have produced a stronger result (lane 6). Combined TPA+IFN-\u03b3 treatment (lane 7) reduced DNA-protein interaction levels, suggesting that more than one pathway may be involved in interaction with the PRE and that these interactions may compete with each other. thumbnailFigure 1. EMSA in stimulated and unstimulated cell culture nuclear extracts and vs. various transcription factor binding oligomers. A. Radiolabeled PRE was incubated with PC12 or U937 nuclear extracts. PC12 extracts were either normal (lane 1) or from cells subject to hypoxia (lane 2). U937 extracts were either normal (lanes 3, 6) or from INF-\u03b3 induced (lane 4), TPA-induced (lane 6), or TPA + INF-\u03b3 induced cells (lane 7). In addition, one sample of normal U937 extract was incubated both with labeled and 200x molar excess of unlabeled PRE (lane 5). Arrows indicate major DNA-protein interactions. B, C. The PRE fragment from plasmid p\u03b2XbB was radiolabeled and incubated in NB or HeLa cell nuclear extracts with or without 200x molar excess competition against oligomers known to bind specific transcription factors. DNA-protein interactions are indicated with arrows. B. NB cell nuclear extracts. No competition (lane 1), competition vs. unlabeled PRE (lane 2), competition vs. unlabeled oligomers that bind AP1 (lane 3), AP2 (lane 4), SP1 (lane 5), or USF1 (lane 6). C. HeLa (lane 1) or TPA-stimulated HeLa (lanes 2\u20136) nuclear extracts. Reactions were subjected to no competition (lanes 1\u20132) competition vs. 200x molar excess of unlabeled PRE fragment (lane 3), AP1-binding oligomer (lane 4), AP2-binding oligomer, or USF-binding oligomer (lane 5). D. EMSA of the PRE in four human tissue nuclear extracts. The DNA fragment corresponding to the PRE (\u221276/-47) was purified from plasmid p\u03b2XbB, radiolabeled, and incubated in nuclear extracts from human lung (lane 1), liver (lane 2), heart (lane 3), or brain (lane 4). DNA-protein interaction band is indicated by arrow. Unbound probe ran at the bottom of the gel (not shown). To narrow down candidate transcription factors predicted by TESS we conducted EMSA with 200x molar excess of unlabeled oligomer pairs known to bind the transcription factors activator protein 1 (AP1), AP2, and SP1, respectively. In addition, to demonstrate that the truncated USF1 site at the 3\u2032-end of the PRE is not active, we competed against an unlabeled commercial oligomer pair known to bind USF1 (Figure 1B, C). Two assays were carried out under the same conditions, one each with nuclear extracts from NB (Figure 1B) and HeLa (Figure 1C) cells, respectively. In NB extracts, competition against AP1, SP1, and USF1 binding oligomer pairs (lanes 3, 5, 6) showed no difference with the uncompeted lane sample (lane 1). Competition with unlabeled PRE eliminated DNA-protein interactions (lane 2), while competition with AP2-binding oligomer pair reduced but did not eliminate interaction, suggesting that PRE interaction in neuronal cells may operate through more than one pathway or at least with more than one potential transcription factor. Competition EMSA in HeLa extracts was in TPA-treated extracts (Figure 1C, lanes 2\u20136). Comparing untreated HeLa nuclear extracts with TPA-treated extracts revealed that TPA induction changed DNA-protein interactions with the PRE (Figure 1C, lanes 1\u20132). Competition with the PRE nearly eliminated DNA-protein interaction (lane 3). Competition with oligomer pairs that bind AP1 (lane 4) and AP2 (lane 5) partially reduced DNA-protein interaction. Competition with the USFl-binding oligomer pairs showed little difference to uncompeted TPA-treated extracts (lane 6). These results indicate that the PRE may interact with AP2, at the very least, but AP2 is neither the sole interaction partner for the PRE in neuronal cells nor under phorbol ester induction. To directly explore tissue specificity of PRE interaction with factors present specifically in whole-tissue human organs in addition to cell cultures, we also carried out EMSA of the PRE fragment in human brain, heart, liver, and lung nuclear extracts. Two of the four extracts tested formed DNA-protein complexes with the PRE, specifically lung and brain extracts (Figure 1D lanes 1, 4). This suggests that the PRE is likely to have tissue-specific function in vivo, in addition to what may be suggested by cell culture results, and that the brain is at least one center of such affinity. DNA-protein interactions in NB nuclear extracts is TF specific by gel supershift EMSAFor further information on specific nuclear factors that would interact with the PRE, we performed supershift EMSA with radiolabeled PRE oligomer pairs in NB nuclear extracts (Figure 2). Extracts were either untreated or co-incubated with antibodies against nuclear factors AP1, AP2, PuF, SP1, or combined AP2 + PuF. As negative controls, we incubated NB extracts with labeled PRE oligomer pairs and antibodies against USF1 or USF2. thumbnailFigure 2. Antibody supershift EMSA of PRE in NB nuclear extracts. Radiolabeled PRE oligomer pairs were incubated with NB cell nuclear extracts (lane 1) and with extracts in the presence of antibodies against transcription factors AP1 (lane 2), AP2 (lane 3), PuF (lane 4), AP2 + PuF (lane 5), SP1 (lane 6), USF1 (lane 7), or USF2 (lane 8). Arrows indicate seven major bands. Incubation of PRE oligomers with NB extracts was not altered by co-incubation with anti-AP1 (lanes 1\u20132), primarily consisting of a single band. As predicted, anti-AP2 and anti-PuF each altered binding of the PRE with NB extracts (lanes 3\u20134). In addition to reducing the major DNA-protein interaction of un-competed PRE (band III), new DNA-protein interactions (bands V and VI) became visible when anti-AP2 was co-incubated. Co-incubation with anti-PuF produced a similar pattern to anti-AP2, with an additional band (IV). Of particular interest is that co-incubation with both antibodies reduced DNA-protein interaction more than did incubation with either antibody alone, and completely eliminated the interaction at band III (lane 5). Co-incubation with anti-SP1 produced a more classic \u201cshift\u201d response (lane 6, band I). Co-incubation with anti-USF1 (lane 7) did not result in any changes. Co-incubation with anti-USF2, on the other hand, produced a response similar to that found with anti-AP2 or anti-PuF. In addition, band II appears, but this band may also be already present but masked by the breadth of band III in untreated reactions. Close examination of lane I indicates that the interaction at band VI may also be present in untreated reactions. Bands IV and V, on the other hand, do not appear when the PRE is incubated with NB extracts in the absence of antibody or in the presence of AP1, SP1, or USF1 antibodies. These results indicate that AP2, PuF, SP1, and USF2 are all potential candidates for interaction with the PRE. Southwestern blotting with the PRE shows different DNA-protein interactions among different cell lines and conditions To ascertain sizes of proteins that participate in some of the observed interactions with the PRE, we performed southwestern blotting with nuclear extracts from NB, PC12, HeLa and TPA-treated HeLa cells (Figure 3). Probing with radiolabeled PRE oligomer pairs revealed that DNA-protein interactions varied among extracts and were subject to induction. NB nuclear extract (lane 1) had major interactions at approximately 92, 33, 32, and 23 kDa (the last an extrapolation outside the range of the size standard). In addition, faint bands appeared at approximately 64, 51, and 39 kDa. The PC12 nuclear extract (lane 2) also had a 33 kDa/32 kDa doublet but lacked a 92 kDa interaction. Instead, an interaction at approximately 60 kDa appears. thumbnailFigure 3. Southwestern blot of PRE vs. cell line nuclear extracts. Nuclear extracts from cell lines NB (lane 1), PC12 (lane 2), HeLa (lane 3), and HeLa treated with TPA (lane 4) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane was probed with radiolabeled PRE oligomers. Blot photographs were size-equalized by use of the same lot of protein standards. Major bands are indicated with solid arrows. Minor bands are indicated with dotted-line arrows. PC12 also had weaker interactions at 92, 39, and 23 kDa. HeLa nuclear extract (lane 3) shared interactions at approximately 92 and between 33 and 32 kDa, with fainter bands at 64, 60, 51, 39, and 23 kDa. Induction of HeLa with TPA (lane 4) resolved the 33/32 kDa band into a doublet and reduced the strength of weaker interactions. Comparison of the observed southwestern bands with molecular weights of predicted transcription factors suggests the possibility that several of the predicted candidate transcription factors may bind to the PRE (Table 2). Table 2. Putative TF sites from southwestern blot based on estimated kDa of bandsThese comparisons were based on a \u00b110% adjustment to the calculated southwestern band kDa. Of the potential DNA-TF interactions, several appear for all nuclear extracts. These are AP2, Msx1, and USF1. A few are unique to human neuroblastoma nuclear extracts, specifically Pax4a, USF2, and BTEB2. There is no signal that can be assigned to PuF subunits, which would be around 17kDa in weight. This may be an artifact of the specific gel\u2019s polyacrylamide percentage. However, the band VI/VII doublet could correspond to PuF dimers. In general, the southwestern does not exclude conclusions of our EMSA-based assays. Mutating the PRE alters DNA-protein interactionTo more specifically determine those sequences within the PRE that participate in gene regulation, we had synthesized a series of oligomer pairs that deleted one or more of the transcription factor sites we predicted to be in the PRE. These mutant oligomers were used for EMSA (Figure 4A, B) in both NB (lanes 1\u20138) and PC12 (lanes 9\u201316) cell nuclear extracts. Mutations resulted in both quantitative and qualitative alterations in DNA-protein interaction as determined by EMSA. Densitometry scans revealed that, at least for some mutants, such as M6, two partially overlapping bands appeared (Figure 4A, lane 7), and the wildtype oligomer pair has an extended trailing end to its peak, suggesting that wildtype binding is to more than one interaction partner. Semi-quantitative analysis, therefore, was done for all samples on each individual peak (division between peaks shown by dashed line in Figure 4A-C). thumbnailFigure 4. EMSA of wildtype and mutant PRE oligomers and semiquantitative analysis of EMSA. Wildtype and mutant PRE oligomers (M1-M7) were incubated with A. NB and B. PC12 nuclear extracts were analyzed on non-denaturing PAGE. Samples were analyzed in triplicate; figure presents a representative gel for each. Bands \u201cI\u201d and \u201cII\u201d as described in the main text are indicated. Dashed line indicates division made between band I and band II for densitometry purposes. C. Cross section of EMSA lanes. ImageJ software was used to evaluate densitometry of scanned films from EMSA of NB and PC12 nuclear extracts with various PRE variant oligomer pairs.

Densitometry readings for EMSA films were normalized to standard deviations and average readings for \u201cwildtype\u201d signal within each film as described in the main text. Normalized readings were compared to the wildtype reading by Dunnett\u2019s multiple t. Means significantly different at p > 0.05 indicated by \u201c*\u201d. D. Band I, NB extract. E. Band I, PC12 extract. F. Band II, NB extract. G. Band II, PC12 extract. Starkly visible qualitative differences were restricted to mutants M1, M4 and M6. The M1 mutants\u2019 predicted binding sites had lower affinity for AP2, GATA1, PuF, one of the two predicted SP1 transcription factor sites, and a downstream GC box. The M4 mutant is predicted to lose the shared GATA1/GATA2 site and the downstream SP1 site, The M6 mutant loses a predicted binding site for zeste homolog/TCERG1. In the case of the first two mutants, the major DNA-protein interaction product\u2019s migration was reduced compared to the wildtype oligomer pair\u2019s primary interaction product (Figure 4C). Analysis of relative migration rates for the wildtype oligomer pair showed that migration of the DNA-protein interaction products for M1 (lanes 2, 10) and M4 (lanes 5, 13) were significantly (p<0.05) reduced from the relative migration rate of wildtype oligomers (lanes 1, 9). The M6 mutation (lanes 7, 15) produced two major DNA-protein interactions in EMSA. The peak of the slower-running interaction was significantly (p<0.05) retarded in PC12 but not NB cells. Samples were processed and analyzed in triplicate and films densitometrically scanned. Densitometry results were normalized by subtracting the mean peak value for a single film and dividing by standard deviation for the film. For data presentation purposes, this was adjusted by subtracting the standardized value of \u201cwildtype\u201d, which sets \u201cwildtype\u201d value to 0 (Figure 4D\u2013G, Tables 3, 4). Adjusted data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s two-tailed t. Hedges g standard pairwise effect sizes [43], using mean square error for pooled standard deviation, were calculated for each variant vs. wildtype PRE (Tables 3, 4). Table 3. Adjusted/normalized ELISA and EMSA signals in NB cells and extractsTable 4. Adjusted/normalized ELISA and EMSA signals in PC12 cells and extractsAnalysis revealed differences between mutation effects on each band\u2019s signal strengths. Specifically, for band I (the slower-migrating band), the M1 mutant had significantly higher adjusted signal than wildtype in NB (Figure 4D, Table 3) nuclear extract. M2 in NB and PC12 extracts had significantly lower adjusted signal than did wildtype (Figure 4E, Table 4). For the dominant wildtype PRE EMSA band (band II), M3 and M7 had significantly higher signal than wildtype in NB (Figure 4F, Table 3) and PC12 (Figure 4G, Table 4) nuclear extracts, while M1 and M4 had significantly reduced signal in NB and PC12 extracts. Mutating the PRE in a reporter gene system produces specific functional differencesTo reveal connections between DNA-protein interactions and expression in mutations of the PRE, we constructed seven plasmids that mutated the PRE sequence identically to the mutant PRE oligomers. These cons-tructs were all based on p\u03b2XbB [17], which contains a promoterless CAT gene sequence under the control of an XbaI/BamHI fragment of the rhesus monkey APP gene promoter and 5\u2032-UTR, specifically \u2212309/+104, with +1 being the transcription start site (Figure 5A). Clones were transfected into PC12 and NB cell cultures as described herein. thumbnailFigure 5. ELISA of PRE variant CAT reporter clones in NB and PC12 cells. Functional differences of PRE mutant clones (M1-M7) from wildtype were assayed in NB and PC12 cells. A. p\u03b2XbB were constructed and transfected into NB or PC12 cell cultures as described in the main text. Cultures were harvested and analyzed by CAT ELISA. ELISA signals were normalized to \u201cwildtype\u201d values and subject to Dunnett\u2019s multiple t. Means significantly different at p > 0.05 indicated by \u201c*\u201d. B. ELISA of samples from NB cell cultures. C. ELISA of samples from PC12 cell cultures. Data presented is back-transformed from statistical analysis. Asymmetrical error bars and Dunnett\u2019s t limits are due to Box-Cox transformation, when used. ELISA results of the functional assay were adjusted for \u03b2-gal levels and made relative to wildtype = 1. Adjusted results were compared to wildtype by Dunnett\u2019s t, and Hedges g was calculated for each pairwise comparison (Tables 3, 4). Functional mutation effects in NB cells (Figure 5B, Table 3) were distinct from PC12 (Figure 5C, Table 4). In NB cells three mutants (M1, M5, and M6) had reduced reporter expression compared to wildtype, and mutant M3, had greater adjusted reporter expression than wildtype. In PC12 cells, mutants M1, M4, M5, and M6 had significantly lower CAT protein levels than wildtype. Mutating predicted locations of putative transcription factor sites in the PRE significantly alters reporter gene expression. These results were consistent between cell lines for the M1 and M5 mutants. Semiquantitative EMSA and ELISA specifically correlate by PRE mutantsWe compared EMSA and ELISA results by meta-analysis of pairwise Hedges g for ELISA and EMSA results vs. wildtype (Figure 6). For both NB and PC12 cells/ nuclear extracts, much weaker correlations were found between EMSA band I and ELISA signal (Figure 6A, B). Stronger correlations existed between EMSA band II and ELISA signal in both cell lines (Table 5; Figure 6C, D). Significance was estimated as chance that r \u2260 0 by bootstrap (500,000 repetitions). thumbnailFigure 6. EMSA vs. ELISA standardized effect sizes for PRE variants in NB and PC12 nuclear extracts and cultures. EMSA and ELISA results were used to generate Hedges pairwise g of comparisons of each mutant to wildtype PRE. Data was plotted with EMSA g on X axis and ELISA g on Y axis. Samples where both EMSA and ELISA signals were significantly different from wildtype at Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05 are indicated with corresponding mutant names. Correlations were bootstrapped (repeats = 100000), and frequency distributions of correlation coefficients are presented as insets. A. EMSA Band I vs. ELISA in NB extract/cells. B. EMSA Band I vs. ELISA in PC12 extract/cells. C. EMSA Band II vs. ELISA in NB extract/cells. D. EMSA Band II vs. ELISA in PC12 extract/cells. Table 5. Meta-analysis of PRE and mutant EMSA vs. ELISAThe percent overlap between the two bootstrap distributions within a single cell line was also calculated. The difference between correlations of EMSA I to ELISA vs. EMSA II to ELISA was more distinct in PC12 cells, with a 16% overlap between the two bootstrap distributions. In NB cells, the two bootstrap distributions overlapped by 34%. While there may be some indication of a direct relationship between EMSA band II signal and reporter ELISA results, we suggest caution in interpreting correlation meta-analysis. In addition to modest, at best, estimations of significance, EMSA bands I and II did not distinctly resolve on autoradiographs in many variants we studied, including wildtype (Figure 4). In addition, cell cultures used for ELISA and nuclear extracts used for EMSA did not come from the same specific cultures. Even with bootstrap estimation, they essentially represent correlations of averaged results from each assay. Nevertheless, we accept the possibility that some correspondence exists between altering the strength of the major DNA-protein interaction for the wildtype olig-omer pair (band II) and functional effects in reporter fusion assay. Mutating the PRE produces cell line-specific and inducible effects, as measured by EMSA To further investigate possible cell line/type-specific effects of the PRE, three mutants, specifically M1, M4, and M6, plus the wildtype PRE, were used as probes in EMSA with nuclear extracts from NB, PC12, human glioblastoma-astrocytoma (U373), HeLa or mouse embryo fibroblast (NIH3T3) cells. In addition, these oligomers were assayed with EMSA with nuclear extracts from HeLa, or NIH3T3 cells that had been subject to induction conditions, such as TPA treatment, serum starvation or induction with cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL6) or transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) (Figure 7). Three apparent bands, marked N (\u201cnull\u201d/\u201czero\u201d), I, and II, appeared among the various nuclear extracts, although no extract/mutant combination had all three bands. In nuclear extracts from NB cells (Figure 7, lanes 1\u20134), DNA-protein interactions were obtained as reported in 3.1. Wildtype oligomers produced a single strong interaction (lane I, band II). The M1 and M4 oligomer pairs each had an interaction that migrated more slowly than did the wildtype (lanes 2\u20133), while M6 had a mixed interaction, with bands that migrated both at the same rate as produced by wildtype and as by M1 (lane 4) oligomer pairs. The PC12 extracts (lanes 5\u20138) produced a pattern similar to that found with NB extracts, excepting that the DNA-protein interaction with M4 (lane 7) has a stronger \u201cleading\u201d edge to its band while the interaction with M6 has a weaker \u201ctrailing\u201d peak in the band doublet (lane 8). thumbnailFigure 7. EMSA of PRE and selected mutants in NB, PC12, HeLa, NIH3T3, and U373 nuclear extracts. Wildtype oligomers (lanes 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33) and oligomers for the M1 (lanes 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34), M4 (lanes 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35), and M6 (lanes 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36) were labeled with \u03b3\u221232P-ATP, incubated with NB (lanes 1\u20134) PC12 (lanes 5\u20138), U373 (lanes 9\u201312), HeLa (lanes 13\u201316), HeLa + TPA (lanes 17\u201320), NIH3T3 (lanes 21\u201324), NIH3T3 + serum restriction (lanes 25\u201328), NIH3T3 + IL6 (lanes 29\u201332), and NIH3T3 + TGF\u03b2 (lanes 33\u201336) nuclear extracts, and analyzed on nondenaturing PAGE, and gels subject to autoradiography. Interactions observed with U373 extracts (lanes 9\u201312) bore some resemblance to those observed with NB and PC12 nuclear extracts specifically for wildtype (lane 9) and M1 (lane 10). However, the M4 and M6 DNA-protein interactions (lanes 11, 12) were noticeably different from both NB and PC12. DNA-protein interactions seen with untreated HeLa nuclear extracts (lanes 13\u201316) did not apparently vary among PRE variants, but treatment of HeLa with TPA (lanes 17\u201320) resulted in a pattern of interactions that was more similar to those with NB and PC12 extracts. Untreated HeLa (lanes 13\u201316) DNA-protein interactions were unlike those found in the other cell lines surveyed. They had an additional band that migrated more slowly than seen for other cell line nuclear extracts. Interaction was very weak with the wildtype oligomer (lane 13), and it appeared as a doublet. The M1 mutant\u2019s interaction was a single band (lane 14), while M4 and M6 interactions were doublets (lanes 14\u201316). Serum starvation of NIH3T3 (lanes 25\u201328) may have slightly reduced interaction with the M4 mutant (lane 27) but appeared to have no other effect. Treatment of NIH3T3 with IL6 (lanes 29\u201332) increases DNA-protein interaction with the M6 oligomer (lane 32, band I). Of particular interest, treatment of NIH3T3 with TGF\u03b2 (lanes 33\u201336) brought about a dramatic shift in DNA-protein interaction bands for the wildtype PRE and all three mutants. While interaction was visibly weaker than for other NIH3T3 based extracts, it very closely resembled that seen for normal NB (lanes 1\u20134) and PC12 (lanes 2\u20138) extracts. The PRE is well-conserved within the human genome and throughout eutherian mammalsTo explore the possibility that the PRE is well-conserved, we examined genomic sequences identified or putatively identified as proximally upstream of the APP gene of 35 mammal species that were aligned by WebPrank[44] as described herein. Information of the alignment was calculated in bits [45,46] and averaged in a window of 100 nt, which roughly corresponds to the distance between nucleosomes in chromosomal DNA as described herein. Examination of the alignment as a whole revealed that the PRE was well conserved compared to immediately flanking sequences. Adding non-primate sequences to the alignment did not change average information content immediately around the PRE (Figure 8A), but average information content for the alignment dropped off significantly (p <0.05, Bonferroni adjusted for 4 comparisons) when on either side of the PRE. Information inversely expresses homogeneity, since 100% homogeneity at a given base is maximum possible score (2 bits) and equal distribution of all four bases would be 0 bits. thumbnailFigure 8. Multiple sequence alignment of APP upstream regions and test of molecular clock. DNA sequences from 20 mammal species were downloaded from GenBank and aligned with WebPrank as described in the main text. A. Average information content in a window of 100 nt and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for primates, euarchontoglires, boreoeutheria, eutheria, and mammals. B. Alignment was used as input for parsimony/FITCH combined phylogeny estimation as described in the main text. This produced a bifurcating non-ultrametric tree, although some branch lengths = 0. The tree was artificially rooted between marsupials and eutheria, and root-to-tip distances for each species calculated. Root-to-tip distances were compared to mean root-to-tip distance for the entire tree. Individual distances that differed from the mean distance (vertical solid line) \u00b1 the 95% (Bonferroni adjusted for 35 comparisons) confidence interval (vertical dashed lines) were counted as \u201csignificant\u201d. Distances that significantly exceeded the mean indicated by \u201c\u2020\u201d. Differences significantly lower than the mean indicated by \u201c*\u201d. Phylogenetic comparison of the alignment (\u2212326/+202 in the human sequence) led, as expected, to rejection of the molecular clock hypothesis (Figure 8B). DNA changes observed within the, admittedly short, region are unlikely to occur simply through neutral sequence drift. Of particular interest is that most of the primate sequences appeared to have a slower-than-typical rate of change vs. the overall tree while mouse and rat sequences had a faster-than-typical rate of change. Further detailed examination was done of the alignment region immediately surrounding the PRE (Figure 9). Alignment was guided by a tree (Figure 9A) based on current conventional mammal phylogeny [47-49], as suggested by the WebPrank protocol. Sequences were taxonomically weighted as described herein and homologies between the human sequence vs. other primates, euarchontoglires, boreoeutheria, eutheria, and all mammals were calculated for the aligned PRE, as were sequence logos [46] for these groups (Figure 9B\u2013F). The PRE remains fairly stable throughout the eutheria, with no less than 92.3% weighted homology to the human sequence (Table 6). Adding marsupials to the estimation reduces homology to 73.8%. Greater aggregate distance from primates also associates with lower specificity within the PRE (Table 6)\u2014total information content (essentially expressing sequence specificity in terms of bits) drops from 49.04 for primates (including humans) to 39.36 when all mammal sequences are considered (Table 6). Of particular interest, the overlapping SP1/PuF site within the PRE is also well conserved among placental mammals (Figure 9E). However, the site breaks down when marsupial sequences are included (Figure 9F). Marsupials also have a 9\u201310 base insertion within the PRE (Figure 9F\u2013G). thumbnailFigure 9.

Analysis of APP proximal promoter region multiple sequence alignmentDiscussionThe APP gene consists of 18 exons and spans more than 300 kilobases on human chromosome 21 [51]. We hypothesize that unusually high production of A\u03b2 may contribute to AD, and this aberrant A\u03b2 production can be a result of unusually high APP gene expression. The APP gene is a likely locus for sporadic, late-onset AD, the most common form of the disease [2,52,53]. Down syndrome patients invariably develop AD, which may be due to additional gene dose of the APP gene in the Down critical region of chromosome 21. In addition, cases of late-onset AD have increased plasma levels of the forms of A\u03b2 [54] specifically associated with the disease. Tissue and cell-type specific expression of the APP gene may also play a role in APP protein or A\u03b2-related pathogenesis. It is well established that mutations in the APP coding sequence can cause autosomal dominant early onset FAD [55]. Some analyses of the coding sequence [56] and the promoter [57] rejected other APP polymorphisms as predisposing to late onset AD (LOAD). However, there are reports of promoter polymorphisms that increase risk for AD in a non-autosomal fashion [58,59], particularly of two polymorphisms in the APP promoter associated with AD pedigrees [23]. In addition, the following results strongly implicate the role of promoter elements in AD. 1) In a genome screen of 292 sib-pairs with LOAD, Hardy\u2019s group identified 12 loci with lod-scores >1 including a region on chromosomes 21 [60]. 2) Using non-parametric linkage methods, Duke\u2019s group showed that a locus predisposing to LOAD might reside in this region of chromosome 21 [61]. 3) Levels of A\u03b2 correlate to cognitive decline in predementia and dementia [62]. 4) Genetic analysis of a case of DS due to non-disjunction suggested triplication of APP in the pathogenesis of AD in Down syndrome [63]. 5) Younkin\u2019s group analyzed plasma A\u03b2 in 180 first-degree relatives of LOAD patients and in 82 age-matched controls. This analysis showed highly significant increase in plasma A\u03b240/42 in the relatives as compared to controls [64,65]. Serial deletion analysis of the APP promoter has revealed several regulatory elements [14,17]. The APP promoter is regulated by several factors, including but not necessarily limited to nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin-l [20,21]. Copper depletion downregulates APP promoter activity [22]. Various groups have reported other transcriptional elements within the first 100 nt from TSS of the APP gene [19,34,66,67]. This includes regulation of APP promoter expression by two GC-elements [67], the zinc finger protein CTCF [66], and upstream stimulatory factor [19]. We previously reported discovering a 30 nt (\u221276/\u221247) fragment from a deletion series of the APP promoter with different effects depending upon cell line [27]. Our discovery was independently paralleled by other workers, who have noted a fragment of the APP promoter at \u221255/\u221233 by DNAse protection assay. This fragment was predicted to contain AP1 and AP4 binding sites, but both were experimentally excluded [15]. Furthermore, deletion of a \u221254/\u221242 fragment of the APP promoter resulted in reduced expression of reporter fusion clones [68]. In addition, deletion of a \u221277/\u221247 fragment resulted in reduced reporter fusion expression in rat primary embryonic hippocampal neurons [69], which was similar to our own observation of the effect of deleting the PRE in rodent cell lines and opposite what we observed in human cell lines [27]. This other work essentially concluded that USF was the responsible agent for regulation through this APP promoter fragment, although it did propose but not test a putative SP1 binding site. We do not dispute that USF may play an important role in APP proximal protein regulation but investigate the possibility that other factors and cofactors also operate on this sequence. We sought to more fully characterize the activity of the PRE as a component of the 5\u2032-flanking region of the APP gene. Transcription factor binding activity was studied by EMSA with human tissue nuclear extracts, including extracts from human brain, followed by EMSA in four different cell line nuclear extracts under different conditions of stimulation or induction. Binding of specific TFs was tested by competition EMSA and by antibody-supershift EMSA. We also used Southwestern blotting to estimate molecular weights of interaction partners with the PRE and compared these with candidate transcription factors. We have determined that the PRE has tissue specificity, showing greater DNA-protein interaction with brain and lung extracts than with liver or heart extracts. In addition, the PRE has cell line-specific DNA-protein interactions with cell nuclear extracts, differing among U937, HeLa, U373, PC12, NIH3T3 cell lines. These interactions are subject to reduction, elimination, or qualitative change by conditions such as hypoxia, SR, and induction with TPA or IFN-\u03b3), IL6, or TGF\u03b2. Our results suggest that the \u221276/\u221247 region binds to a protein that is upregulated in serum starvation, and downregulated in hypoxia. Because serum starvation contributes to the induction of apoptosis, these results suggest a role of the 30-nt proximal APP promoter element in enhanced apoptotic neuronal cell death. Competition EMSA and antibody-supershift EMSA confirmed predicted interactions between the PRE and AP2, while antibody-supershift EMSA confirmed interaction between the PRE and AP2, PuF, SP1, and USF2. Competition and supershift EMSA appear to contradict each other regarding SP1. Possible biological explanations could include sufficiently high affinity within the PRE for SP1 to overcome competition with the particular commercial probe used. High PRE-SP1 affinity could result in a \u201cnegative\u201d competition result but a positive supershift, since the supershift is meant to detect SP1 when bound to the target DNA. Alternatively, our supershift may be interacting with an SP1-like transcription factor that binds the PRE but has a lower affinity with the consensus SP1 site in the commercial competition oligomer. Southwestern blotting indicated possible interactions between the PRE and AP2, SP1, and USF2, among other TF. It also admitted the possibility of PRE-PuF dimer interaction. We mutated the PRE and highlighted a specific effect of the sequence that included the predicted PuF/SP1 binding site. Our mutant expression evidence tends to agree with our EMSA evidence. Of the mutants characterized, M1 was the most consistent in response across NB and PC12x cells and nuclear extracts. Specifically, semi-quantitative EMSA with M1 probe resulted in significant signal loss at the band position that corresponded closely to the major band of wildtype PRE EMSA in both NB and PC12 nuclear extracts. Likewise, M1 mutant promoter/reporter expression clones resulted in significantly reduced levels of CAT reporter protein in both NB and PC12 cells. The M1 mutant deleted the predicted PuF site and both predicted SP1 sites in the PRE. We note that M2 and M4 each also deleted a single predicted SP1 site, the specific site differing between M2 and M4. EMSA analysis of these two mutants showed that M4 consistently had reduced EMSA interaction at band II, while M2 did not. However, CAT reporter levels were not consistently altered between cell types. There-fore, our mutation analysis confirms our earlier conclusion that the PRE is most likely to function as a site of PuF and SP1 activity. Disruption of the shared PuF/SP1 site in our system resulted in reduced levels of reporter gene product, which appears to contradict part of our proposed model. However primary sequence disruption of the site would influence both PuF (repressive) and SP1 (stimulatory) interaction very strongly. In addition, disruption of the AP2 site also resulted in loss of EMSA signal, suggesting that the PRE may also function under induction as well as constitutively. Currently, two DNA sequence polymorphisms have been reported for the PRE, specifically rs200621906 and rs201592736 [37]. Each is predicted to alter potential TF binding sites within the PRE (Table 7). Of particular note, rs201592736 may interfere with the PuF site. In addition, potentially interesting sites were created, including glucocorticoid/progesterone receptor (GR/PR), NF1-like enkephalin nuclear transcription factor 1 (NKTF1) retinoic acid receptor \u03b3 (RAR\u03b3), and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1),. Glucocorticoid levels are well associated with AD risk [70]. Progesterone supplementation has been linked to more rapid age-related cognitive decline in post-menopausal women [71,72]. Elevated levels of enkephalin contribute to neurological impairment and tau phosphorylation in AD model animals [73]. Upregulation of enkephalin accompanied by upregulation of APP due to an SNP in the PRE may overwhelm natural defenses against neurodegeneration. RARs direct APP processing toward the non-pathogenic \u03b1 pathway [74], and it is conceivable that a feedback mechanism that results in RAR-mediated overproduction of APP in a natural PRE mutant may overwhelm this process. ZEB1 interacts with TGF\u03b2 [75], and TGF\u03b2 is implicated in AD pathogenesis [76,77]. The rs201592736 SNP approximates our M2 mutant, while rs200621906 approximates M4. Combining both polymorphisms approximates the TF deletion effects of M1, which showed significant Bonferroni-adjusted reductions in both EMSA and CAT reporter by meta-analysis. Population frequency of these SNPs has not been published, and it has not been yet determined if they occur as a haplotype or independently. It should be cautioned that, although they have interesting potential TF site changes, functional association with any disease state has also not been determined. Table 7. Natural SNP in the PREThe PRE is strongly conserved in placental mammals, particularly the PuF/SP1 overlapping site. In addition, this conservation occurs in a promoter region that has undergone significant non-neutral (i. e., non-molecular clock) change. In particular, primate and mouse/rat sequences diverge the most from each other in our root-to-tip ana-lysis, but with far less difference when considering the PRE, specifically. We propose that this particular short segment of the APP proximal regulatory region has been specifically maintained, as would be expected of an active promoter segment. We have previously stated that other AD-associated gene promoters, such as for APOE, have important differences between mouse and human [25]. Likewise, we have reported both differences and similarities between human and rat cell line responses to functional promoter deletion clones of the human MAPT promoter [26]. Such overall differences can be put to use in identifying potentially critical regions of similarity, such as the PRE within the APP promoter. Although two SNPs have been reported in the human PRE, it is unlikely, given their obscurity in the literature, that these would be common enough to explain a large proportion of sporadic AD. We propose that the majority of etiologically important PuF vs. SP1 disruption in the PRE would be due to environmental influences on epigenetic markers. The naturally-occurring SNPs could serve as a potential test bed, given their similarity in terms of TF site disruption to some of our synthetic mutants. It is potentially more interesting that the Puf/SP1 site consists primarily of GG and GGG sequences, which are particularly vulnerable to DNA oxidation [78]. While SP1 activity is sensitive to epigenetic DNA modification [79], and PuF operates in repair of DNA damage [80], relative effects of DNA oxidation upon each protein\u2019s activity as a transcription factor have not been established. Likewise, CpG dimers (sites of cytosine methylation) are immediately adjacent to the PuF/SP1 site. Thus, in our system, while disrupting both PuF and SP1 activity by primary sequence mutation may result in overall reduction in reporter levels, environmentally-induced epigenetic alterations to the shared target DNA sequence may favor SP1 stimulation over PuF inhibition. In light of the knowledge that overall PuF activity may be reduced in AD, we do not suggest that epigenetic modification of the PRE would be the sole cause of the disorder. Rather, it would contribute to disruption of normal APP gene expression that would accompany AD. Feedback mechanisms between APP and other misregulated AD associated genes may serve to also reduce PuF activity in concert with direct disruption of APP-PuF interaction. We admit that our current assignment of PuF and SP1 to active status within the PRE has not yet been directly tested. Mammalian PuF is associated with inhibition of invasive metastasis [81-84] and stimulation of normal cell proliferation [85,86]. PuF kinase activity was reduced in human brain in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Down syndrome [87]. Total APP mRNA is elevated in AD brain, specifically KPI(+) isoforms [88]. APP gene expression and SP1 activity are increased in aging primate brains [31]. SP1-DNA interaction and APP expression in mouse brains are increased in a latent fashion by early-life dietary administration of Pb [29]. We suggest an antagonistic role between PuF and SP1, specifically that PuF may serve to downregulate APP gene expression via the PRE in vivo, and increases in effective SP1 activity, due to increased SP1 levels, interference in PuF-DNA interaction at the PRE, or decrease in PuF levels, for example, may overwhelm PuF regulation. The PuF transcription factor/kinase was discovered in the context of inhibiting metastasis [28]. Such inhibition included through interaction with the MYC gene promoter [89,90]. Later, PuF was determined to also function as a kinase independently of its TF activity [91]. PuF TF activity was determined to not only act to inhibit metastasis, but to also operate in non-metastatic cell proliferation [85,86]. In addition to cell proliferative activity, PuF regulates insulin secretion from pancreas islet cells [92], providing another molecular link underlying the recently-proposed metabolic-cognitive syndrome that may unite metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders [93]. We propose that these aspects of PuF may prove important in understanding both AD pathogenesis and the possibility that a role may be played by APP gene products in oncogenesis. Of greater interest is that PuF has already been indirectly linked to AD before our work with the PRE. PuF interacts with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1 (CAMK2N1) [94]. CAMK2N1 is, itself, a potent inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2), which is a mediator of learning and memory [95]. CAMK2 is currently a target of several anti-AD drugs under investigation [96]. Of particular note is that the PRE exists within a DNAse I hypersensitive region [97], and PuF activity is modulated by the presence or absence of a DNAse I hypersensitive region [87]. Likewise, among its amazing variety of functions [98,99], the APP protein is a ferroxidase and activates ferroportin to export iron from neurons [100]. Iron chelation reduces APP protein levels through the APP mRNA 5\u2019-UTR [101], and this is reversed by iron supplementation. Conversely, overexpression of APP results in reduced iron content and increased oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma cells [102]. Although it has also been shown that abnormally high levels of iron accumulate in specific brain regions in AD, particularly within and around amyloid plaques [103], this is not paradoxical, since plaque-associated iron would be extracellular and could be in part due to overactivity of APP in iron transport. In addition, faulty iron metabolism has been strongly linked to cancer and neoplasia, specifically through ferroportin activity [104], and increased serum iron is associated with greater risk for oxidative damage to DNA [105]. Of particular interest for a possible oncology/APP association is that expression of the APP gene in response to iron chelators distinctly differed between neoplastic and normal cell lines [106]. In cancer patients, increased APP gene expression was more common in tumor tissue of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients than in non-cancerous matched tissue samples. More importantly, in those patients who had elevated APP expression, survival at 24 months was 48% vs. 82% for patients with non-elevated APP expression [107]. This suggests that PuF may exert anti-metastatic properties by, in part, altering levels of APP expression, reducing overall results of APP protein\u2019s ferroxidase activity and modulating cancer risk. Basal activity of the APP promoter is greatest in neural origin cell lines, and several promoter elements close to the PRE are important for this activity [108]. For example, the APP promoter contains binding sites for important TFs, such as purine-rich element binding protein-\u03b1 (PUR\u03b1) [109] and early growth response 1 (EGR1) [110]. Notably, there is a high expression of PUR\u03b1 and EGR1 in neurons during brain development and in the adult brain, and negative regulation of APP gene expression by PUR\u03b1 [109]. ConclusionsInterference with TF binding to the PRE in the context of the complete APP promoter could serve to deregulate APP production. Deletion of the PRE from a complete series of APP promoter clones resulted in a 3 to 4 fold gain of promoter activity in NB cells as measured by levels of reporter gene product [27]. While AP2 and USF2 (implicated in our antibody supershifts) are generally stimulatory factors, the normal function of PuF is usually inhibitory of pathogenic cell proliferation, specifically metastasis [83,84]. In addition to inhibiting metastasis, PuF serves to induce normal cell proliferation [83,84]. The APP protein, among its non-pathological functions, is active in the \u201cneuronal pruning\u201d stage of brain development, wherein neurons in the early brain are selectively removed after rapid proliferation [111]. In addition to neurogenesis, PuF homologues regulate early morphological development [112]. Thus, as PuF serves to stimulate non-pathogenic cell proliferation, and APP can act to reduce cell proliferation, it is reasonable to propose the possibility that PuF acts to downregulate APP expression under normal circumstances, and interference in PuF regulation through the PRE could serve to deregulate APP gene expression, potentially contributing to AD pathogenesis (Figure 10). A\u03b2 is a minority product of APP processing [113]. Therefore, increase in APP levels could raise A\u03b2 above a risk threshold for AD. A theoretical union of oncogenic and neurodegenerative models has been proposed in the latent early-life associated regulation (LEARn) model of idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders [38,39], expands and extends the \u201cn-hit\u201d model of pathogenesis commonly accepted in oncology to \u201csporadic\u201d neurodegenerative disorders. Given that the predicted PuF site may be structurally vulnerable to GG oxidation, and thus subject to the LEARn model, we conclude that our work suggests connections between processes that lead to cancer etiology and sporadic neurobiological disorders, both conceptually (LEARn vs. n-hit) and mechanistically (PuF regulation of APP vs. PuF regulation of metastasis). thumbnailFigure 10. Model of Antagonistic PuF vs. SP1 regulation of the APP gene and disruption in AD. A. Non-pathogenic APP expression, levels regulated by PuF. In normal brain, PuF would compete with SP1 at the PRE and result in normal levels of APP mRNA and protein. A\u03b2 would be restricted to non-pathogenic concentrations. B. Pathogenic APP expression resulting from disruption of PuF regulation of the PRE. Disruption of the PRE, such as through environmentally induced DNA oxidation at GG dimers, \u201c*\u201d, may reduce affinity of the PRE for PuF more severely than for SP1. Effective SP1 activity then serves to upregulate APP expression levels beyond a pathogenic threshold. MethodsReagents and enzymesUnless specifically noted otherwise, reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA) or Roche Life Science (Indianapolis, IN). Cell culturePC12 and NB cell lines were obtained from ATCC and cultured as described previously [114]. The plates were incubated in 5% CO2 in a 37\u00b0C incubator. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen/Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). PRE fragments and oligomersThe rhesus monkey APP promoter clone p\u03b2XbB [17] (Figure 11) was digested with restriction enzymes PvuII and XhoI and run on a 10% TAE-polyacrylamide gel. The cell type specific 30 nt (\u221276/\u221247) PRE [27] was purified and end-labeled with \u03b332P-ATP (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). In addition, oligomers corresponding to this sequence and its reverse complement were synthesized (Invitrogen) and similarly radiolabeled. The oligomer pair differs from the plasmid fragment in that it does not have a \u201cTCGA\u201d 5\u2032 overhang. This overhang was filled for wildtype and mutant (see \u201cSemiquantitative EMSA of mutant PRE oligomers\u2026\u201d, herein) synthetic double-stranded oligomers. thumbnailFigure 11. Clone p\u03b2XbB. A deletion series of 6kb of the APP promoter and 5\u2032-UTR was previously constructed [17]. Within this series, an XbaI/BamHI 408bp fragment of the APP proximal promoter and 5\u2032-UTR was inserted in the expression vector pBLCAT3 (Promega). This fragment contained the PRE. The clone was used as the base template for all mutagenesis described herein. Analysis of potential transcription factor binding sites on the PREThe TESS [40] and MatInspector [41] utilities were used to probe the TransFac database with the PRE sequence. EMSA of PRE fragments in human tissue nuclear extractsCell nuclei extracts from human brain, heart, liver, and lungs were prepared as previously described [115,116]. The assay was carried out with 40 pg of PRE from digestion of p\u03b2XbB (about 10,000 cpm) and 10 to 20 \u03bcg of nuclear extracts. Radioactive probe was incubated with human brain, heart, liver, or lung nuclear extracts in 24\u03bcl of EMSA-binding buffer (Active Motif, Carlsbad CA) at 6\u00b0\u20138\u00b0C for 40 minutes. The samples were mixed with loading dye and the products of the reaction were separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in 1 x TGE (50 mM Tris, 384 mM glycine, and 2 mM EDTA). The gel was dried and exposed to X-ray film for autoradiography. Free oligonucleotides ran at the bottom of the gel. Protein-DNA complexes were detected as mobility-retarded bands. EMSA in nuclear extracts from normal and variously stimulated PC12 and human U937 cells Nuclear extracts were obtained commercially (ActiveMotif). PRE oligomer pairs were annealed and radiolabeled as described herein. Radioactive oligomer pairs were incubated with nuclear extracts from PC12, hypoxic PC12, U937, and U937 stimulated with either IFN-\u03b3, TPA, or IFN-\u03b3 + TPA. In addition, one sample was incubated with U937 nuclear extracts and 200x molar excess of unlabeled PRE oligomer pairs. Reaction mixtures were analyzed on nondenaturing PAGE and the gel used for autoradiography. Competition EMSA in nuclear extracts from NB and HeLa cellsCell nuclear extracts from NB and either HeLa cultures or HeLa treated with TPA were obtained commercially (Active Motif). Oligomer pairs for the PRE were annealed and radiolabeled as described herein. Nuclear extracts and oligomer pairs were incubated as described herein, except that some individual samples were incubated with 200x molar excess of unlabeled oligomer pairs. NB extracts were either uncompeted or competed against unlabeled PRE or commercially-obtained oligomer pairs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) known to bind AP1, AP2, SP1, or USF1. EMSA in unstimulated HeLa extracts was not subject to competition. Extracts from TPA-stimulated HeLa were either uncompeted or competed against unlabeled PRE or commercially-obtained oligomers known\n\t\t\t", "question_id": "1", "question_str": "What is the transcriptional activator that stimulates the gene expression of APP?", "answer_options": {"answer_id": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"], "answer_str": ["PuF", "SP1", "NB cells", "metastasis", "PvuII"]}, "correct_answer_id": "2", "correct_answer_str": "SP1"}, {"topic_id": "1", "topic_name": "Alzheimer_Task", "test_id": "4", "document_id": "4", "document_str": "\nBMC Genomics | Full text | PuF, an antimetastatic and developmental signaling protein, interacts with the Alzheimer's amyloid-beta precursor protein via a tissue-specific proximal regulatory element (PRE)Top Abstract Background Results Discussion Conclusions Methods Abbreviations Competing interests Authors\u2019 contributions Acknowledgements References \ufffc\ufffc BMC GenomicsVolume 14Viewing optionsAbstract Full text PDF (1.7MB) Associated materialPubMed record About this articleReaders' comments Related literatureCited byGoogle blog searchOther articles by authorson Google Scholar Lahiri DK Maloney B Rogers JT Ge YW on PubMed Lahiri DK Maloney B Rogers JT Ge YW Related articles/pageson Googleon Google Scholaron PubMedToolsDownload references Download XMLEmail to a friend Order reprintsPost a comment Share this articleTweet More options...

Formula display:\ufffcAbstractBackgroundAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is intimately tied to amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide. Extraneuronal brain plaques consisting primarily of A\u03b2 aggregates are a hallmark of AD. Intraneuronal A\u03b2 subunits are strongly implicated in disease progression. Protein sequence mutations of the A\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) account for a small proportion of AD cases, suggesting that regulation of the associated gene (APP) may play a more important role in AD etiology. The APP promoter possesses a novel 30 nucleotide sequence, or \u201cproximal regulatory element\u201d (PRE), at \u221276/\u221247, from the +1 transcription start site that confers cell type specificity. This PRE contains sequences that make it vulnerable to epigenetic modification and may present a viable target for drug studies. We examined PRE-nuclear protein interaction by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and PRE mutant EMSA. This was followed by functional studies of PRE mutant/reporter gene fusion clones. ResultsEMSA probed with the PRE showed DNA-protein interaction in multiple nuclear extracts and in human brain tissue nuclear extract in a tissue-type specific manner. We identified transcription factors that are likely to bind the PRE, using competition gel shift and gel supershift: Activator protein 2 (AP2), nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase/metastatic inhibitory protein (PuF), and specificity protein 1 (SP1). These sites crossed a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). EMSA with PRE mutants and promoter/reporter clone transfection analysis further implicated PuF in cells and extracts. Functional assays of mutant/reporter clone transfections were evaluated by ELISA of reporter protein levels. EMSA and ELISA results correlated by meta-analysis. ConclusionsWe propose that PuF may regulate the APP gene promoter and that AD risk may be increased by interference with PuF regulation at the PRE. PuF is targeted by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1, which also interacts with the integrins. These proteins are connected to vital cellular and neurological functions. In addition, the transcription factor PuF is a known inhibitor of metastasis and regulates cell growth during development. Given that APP is a known cell adhesion protein and ferroxidase, this suggests biochemical links among cell signaling, the cell cycle, iron metabolism in cancer, and AD in the context of overall aging. Keywords: Amyloid precursor protein; Alzheimer\u2019s disease; Cancer; Gene regulation; Gene transcription; Iron; Latency; nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase; Oncogenesis; PuF; SP1; Specificity protein 1; Transcription factorBackgroundA diagnostic feature of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is aggregation of toxic amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) into extracellular plaques, suspected of causing or contributing to disease progression [1,2]. In addition, intracellular A\u03b2 has been implicated as having a pathological role in AD and Down syndrome [3], and A\u03b2 may function as a transcription factor (TF) [4,5]. A\u03b2 is cleaved from a larger precursor protein (APP) by a process involving two secretase enzymes, \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase [2]. Hyperphosphorylated \u03c4 protein and \u03b1-synuclein also have a likely role in AD etiology [6-8], and apolipoprotein E (APOE) is linked to a large proportion of cases of AD both by genetic [9,10] and cholesterol-related functional studies [11]. We hypothesize that unusually high production of A\u03b2 significantly contributes to AD, and this aberrant A\u03b2 production can result from unusually high APP gene (APP) expression, particularly in a tissue and cell-type specific manner. Several groups have studied the 5\u2032-flanking region of the APP gene, including its promoter [12-16]. Serial deletion analysis has shown that the APP promoter [14,17] and 5\u2032-UTR [18] contain several regulatory elements that are likely to modulate transcriptional activity. In addition to proximal regulatory regions, two upstream sequences have been identified that regulate the gene\u2019s expression [14], including one that has been shown to generally stimulate APP production [19]. The APP promoter is regulated by a variety of factors. It can be stimulated by nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin-l [20,21], and copper depletion downregulates its activity [22]. A link between APP gene regulation and pathologies such as AD has been shown, for example, by characterization of two APP promoter polymorphisms associated with the pathogenesis of some forms of AD [23]. The more upstream of these two polymorphic sites may function as a target site for A\u03b2 acting as a transcription factor [4,5]. Our group has examined regulatory regions of important AD-associated genes, including APOE[24,25] and microtubule-associated protein \u03c4 (MAPT) [26]. We have also previously characterized a deletion series of the APP promoter in eight different cell lines from five different tissue types in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter construct [27]. We discovered that a novel 30 nucleotide (nt) sequence of \u221276 to \u221247 from the +1 transcription start site (TSS) had differential effect depending upon cell line. In human kidney epithelial cells, deletion of this element resulted in 50-fold reduction of CAT reporter gene activity. In human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma (NB) cells, deletion resulted in a 3 to 4-fold gain of reporter gene activity, the greatest NB cell expression for all clones of the deletion series. We thus termed this region the \u201cproximal regulatory element\u201d (PRE) of the APP gene. We examined the nature of DNA-protein interaction with this DNA fragment by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA or gel shift). Notably, use of the PRE as a probe in EMSA showed evidence of DNA-protein interaction with this sequence in multiple cell line nuclear extracts and in mouse brain tissue nuclear extract [27]. However, the specific nature of nuclear proteins that interact with the PRE in different cell types was not determined at that time. We continue our work on the PRE by exploring specific DNA-protein interactions in EMSA, competition EMSA, and antibody-supershift EMSA. Functional effects were measured by creation of a library of mutant PRE sequences within a previously constructed [17]APP-CAT fusion clone. While we had previously shown that the PRE interacts with nuclear proteins in a tissue-type specific manner, we herein identified TFs that were likely bind to the PRE, specifically activator protein 2 (AP2), nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase/metastatic inhibitory protein (PuF), and specificity protein 1 (SP1). We also characterized quantitative and qualitative effects of mutating the PRE vs. DNA-protein interaction in EMSA vs. both NB and rat neuronal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and cell nuclear extracts. Functional assays of PRE mutation effects were performed by transiently transfecting the mutant-CAT clones into human neuroblastoma and rat neuronal pheochromocytoma cell cultures. We discovered specific, significant mutation-dependent function differences. We compared the EMSA results to effects of the same mutations in functional mutant-CAT clone transfection assays. Altering the PRE\u2019s ability to bind TF corresponded to functional changes in promoter activity in a cell line-specific manner. We determined that PuF and SP1 are candidates for regulation of the APP gene through the PRE. PuF\u2019s better-known function is as an inhibitor of metastasis [28]. SP1 activity in APP regulation has already been well demonstrated [29-33]. SP1 sites have been located in both the promoter [13,32,34] and 5\u2032-UTR portions of the APP 5\u2032-flanking region [35,36]. Our data led us to propose that SP1 and PuF act antagonistically through the PRE, with SP1 stimulating and PuF repressing APP transcription. These two TF sites can be subject to natural variation in the human genome, as they cross a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [37]. The PRE sequence contains sites for DNA methylation and oxidation, suggesting the site may be vulnerable to environmentally-mediated epigenetic modification. Should such interference with PuF regulation of APP increase risk of AD, it would be another similarity between etiology of sporadic/idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders and oncogenesis, extending our previous work in developing the latent early-life associated regulation (LEARn) model [38,39] of idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders. ResultsPutative transcription factor sites within the PREThe PRE with an additional 10nt flanking sequence at either end was used with TESS [40] and MatInspector [41] to probe the TransFac database [42]. Restricting predicted sites to mammal TF matrices and eliminating redundant sites resulted in predicted affinities with several transcription factors (Table 1), including AP2, GATA binding proteins 1 (GATA1) and 2 (GATA2), two GC boxes, paired box gene 4-a (Pax4a), PuF, Epstein-Barr virus transcription factor R (R), SP1, and transcription elongation regulator 1 (mammal homologue to zeste, TCERG1). Truncated upstream stimulatory factor (USF)1 and USF2 sites were also found at the 3\u2032-end of the PRE. The GC box is associated with the binding of several transcription factors, including SP1, basic transcription element binding protein (BTEB)1, BTEB2, and msh homeobox 1 (Msx1). Table 1. Predicted TF sites in the PREDNA-protein interaction of the PRE by EMSA varies among tissue types and cell line conditions To investigate cell type specificity of PRE-protein interactions, we used the PRE fragment in EMSA with nuclear extracts from PC12 and human cervical epithelial (HeLa), SK-N-BE neuroblastoma (NB), and histiocytic lymphoma (U937) cells (Figure 1A\u2013C) and with nuclear extracts from human tissues (Figure 1D). PC12 extracts (Figure 1A) were obtained from both normal and hypoxic cells (lanes 1\u20132). U937 extracts (Figure 1A) included nuclei from untreated cells and from cells treated with interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or TPA + IFN-\u03b3 (lanes 3\u20137). In addition, to test specificity of PRE binding with untreated U937 extracts, we also competed the PRE/U937 EMSA against 200x molar excess unlabeled PRE fragment (lane 5). Nuclear extract EMSA showed definite interaction between the PRE and both PC12 and U937 extracts. This interaction was competed away with excess PRE in U937 extracts. DNA-protein interactions could be altered by specific treatment of cells from which extracts were taken. Hypoxia greatly reduced the observed interaction in PC12 extracts (lane 2). Treatment with the cytokine IFN-\u03b3 may have slightly increased interaction in U937 extracts (lane 4), but TPA treatment seems to have produced a stronger result (lane 6). Combined TPA+IFN-\u03b3 treatment (lane 7) reduced DNA-protein interaction levels, suggesting that more than one pathway may be involved in interaction with the PRE and that these interactions may compete with each other. thumbnailFigure 1.

To narrow down candidate transcription factors predicted by TESS we conducted EMSA with 200x molar excess of unlabeled oligomer pairs known to bind the transcription factors activator protein 1 (AP1), AP2, and SP1, respectively. In addition, to demonstrate that the truncated USF1 site at the 3\u2032-end of the PRE is not active, we competed against an unlabeled commercial oligomer pair known to bind USF1 (Figure 1B, C). Two assays were carried out under the same conditions, one each with nuclear extracts from NB (Figure 1B) and HeLa (Figure 1C) cells, respectively. In NB extracts, competition against AP1, SP1, and USF1 binding oligomer pairs (lanes 3, 5, 6) showed no difference with the uncompeted lane sample (lane 1). Competition with unlabeled PRE eliminated DNA-protein interactions (lane 2), while competition with AP2-binding oligomer pair reduced but did not eliminate interaction, suggesting that PRE interaction in neuronal cells may operate through more than one pathway or at least with more than one potential transcription factor. Competition EMSA in HeLa extracts was in TPA-treated extracts (Figure 1C, lanes 2\u20136). Comparing untreated HeLa nuclear extracts with TPA-treated extracts revealed that TPA induction changed DNA-protein interactions with the PRE (Figure 1C, lanes 1\u20132). Competition with the PRE nearly eliminated DNA-protein interaction (lane 3). Competition with oligomer pairs that bind AP1 (lane 4) and AP2 (lane 5) partially reduced DNA-protein interaction. Competition with the USFl-binding oligomer pairs showed little difference to uncompeted TPA-treated extracts (lane 6). These results indicate that the PRE may interact with AP2, at the very least, but AP2 is neither the sole interaction partner for the PRE in neuronal cells nor under phorbol ester induction. To directly explore tissue specificity of PRE interaction with factors present specifically in whole-tissue human organs in addition to cell cultures, we also carried out EMSA of the PRE fragment in human brain, heart, liver, and lung nuclear extracts. Two of the four extracts tested formed DNA-protein complexes with the PRE, specifically lung and brain extracts (Figure 1D lanes 1, 4). This suggests that the PRE is likely to have tissue-specific function in vivo, in addition to what may be suggested by cell culture results, and that the brain is at least one center of such affinity. DNA-protein interactions in NB nuclear extracts is TF specific by gel supershift EMSAFor further information on specific nuclear factors that would interact with the PRE, we performed supershift EMSA with radiolabeled PRE oligomer pairs in NB nuclear extracts (Figure 2). Extracts were either untreated or co-incubated with antibodies against nuclear factors AP1, AP2, PuF, SP1, or combined AP2 + PuF. As negative controls, we incubated NB extracts with labeled PRE oligomer pairs and antibodies against USF1 or USF2. thumbnailFigure 2. Antibody supershift EMSA of PRE in NB nuclear extracts. Radiolabeled PRE oligomer pairs were incubated with NB cell nuclear extracts (lane 1) and with extracts in the presence of antibodies against transcription factors AP1 (lane 2), AP2 (lane 3), PuF (lane 4), AP2 + PuF (lane 5), SP1 (lane 6), USF1 (lane 7), or USF2 (lane 8). Arrows indicate seven major bands. Incubation of PRE oligomers with NB extracts was not altered by co-incubation with anti-AP1 (lanes 1\u20132), primarily consisting of a single band. As predicted, anti-AP2 and anti-PuF each altered binding of the PRE with NB extracts (lanes 3\u20134). In addition to reducing the major DNA-protein interaction of un-competed PRE (band III), new DNA-protein interactions (bands V and VI) became visible when anti-AP2 was co-incubated. Co-incubation with anti-PuF produced a similar pattern to anti-AP2, with an additional band (IV). Of particular interest is that co-incubation with both antibodies reduced DNA-protein interaction more than did incubation with either antibody alone, and completely eliminated the interaction at band III (lane 5). Co-incubation with anti-SP1 produced a more classic \u201cshift\u201d response (lane 6, band I). Co-incubation with anti-USF1 (lane 7) did not result in any changes. Co-incubation with anti-USF2, on the other hand, produced a response similar to that found with anti-AP2 or anti-PuF. In addition, band II appears, but this band may also be already present but masked by the breadth of band III in untreated reactions. Close examination of lane I indicates that the interaction at band VI may also be present in untreated reactions. Bands IV and V, on the other hand, do not appear when the PRE is incubated with NB extracts in the absence of antibody or in the presence of AP1, SP1, or USF1 antibodies. These results indicate that AP2, PuF, SP1, and USF2 are all potential candidates for interaction with the PRE. Southwestern blotting with the PRE shows different DNA-protein interactions among different cell lines and conditions To ascertain sizes of proteins that participate in some of the observed interactions with the PRE, we performed southwestern blotting with nuclear extracts from NB, PC12, HeLa and TPA-treated HeLa cells (Figure 3). Probing with radiolabeled PRE oligomer pairs revealed that DNA-protein interactions varied among extracts and were subject to induction. NB nuclear extract (lane 1) had major interactions at approximately 92, 33, 32, and 23 kDa (the last an extrapolation outside the range of the size standard). In addition, faint bands appeared at approximately 64, 51, and 39 kDa. The PC12 nuclear extract (lane 2) also had a 33 kDa/32 kDa doublet but lacked a 92 kDa interaction. Instead, an interaction at approximately 60 kDa appears. thumbnailFigure 3. Southwestern blot of PRE vs. cell line nuclear extracts. Nuclear extracts from cell lines NB (lane 1), PC12 (lane 2), HeLa (lane 3), and HeLa treated with TPA (lane 4) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane was probed with radiolabeled PRE oligomers. Blot photographs were size-equalized by use of the same lot of protein standards. Major bands are indicated with solid arrows. Minor bands are indicated with dotted-line arrows. PC12 also had weaker interactions at 92, 39, and 23 kDa. HeLa nuclear extract (lane 3) shared interactions at approximately 92 and between 33 and 32 kDa, with fainter bands at 64, 60, 51, 39, and 23 kDa. Induction of HeLa with TPA (lane 4) resolved the 33/32 kDa band into a doublet and reduced the strength of weaker interactions. Comparison of the observed southwestern bands with molecular weights of predicted transcription factors suggests the possibility that several of the predicted candidate transcription factors may bind to the PRE (Table 2). Table 2. Putative TF sites from southwestern blot based on estimated kDa of bandsThese comparisons were based on a \u00b110% adjustment to the calculated southwestern band kDa. Of the potential DNA-TF interactions, several appear for all nuclear extracts. These are AP2, Msx1, and USF1. A few are unique to human neuroblastoma nuclear extracts, specifically Pax4a, USF2, and BTEB2. There is no signal that can be assigned to PuF subunits, which would be around 17kDa in weight. This may be an artifact of the specific gel\u2019s polyacrylamide percentage. However, the band VI/VII doublet could correspond to PuF dimers. In general, the southwestern does not exclude conclusions of our EMSA-based assays. Mutating the PRE alters DNA-protein interactionTo more specifically determine those sequences within the PRE that participate in gene regulation, we had synthesized a series of oligomer pairs that deleted one or more of the transcription factor sites we predicted to be in the PRE. These mutant oligomers were used for EMSA (Figure 4A, B) in both NB (lanes 1\u20138) and PC12 (lanes 9\u201316) cell nuclear extracts. Mutations resulted in both quantitative and qualitative alterations in DNA-protein interaction as determined by EMSA. Densitometry scans revealed that, at least for some mutants, such as M6, two partially overlapping bands appeared (Figure 4A, lane 7), and the wildtype oligomer pair has an extended trailing end to its peak, suggesting that wildtype binding is to more than one interaction partner. Semi-quantitative analysis, therefore, was done for all samples on each individual peak (division between peaks shown by dashed line in Figure 4A-C). thumbnailFigure 4. EMSA of wildtype and mutant PRE oligomers and semiquantitative analysis of EMSA. Wildtype and mutant PRE oligomers (M1-M7) were incubated with A. NB and B. PC12 nuclear extracts were analyzed on non-denaturing PAGE. Samples were analyzed in triplicate; figure presents a representative gel for each. Bands \u201cI\u201d and \u201cII\u201d as described in the main text are indicated. Dashed line indicates division made between band I and band II for densitometry purposes. C. Cross section of EMSA lanes. ImageJ software was used to evaluate densitometry of scanned films from EMSA of NB and PC12 nuclear extracts with various PRE variant oligomer pairs.

Densitometry readings for EMSA films were normalized to standard deviations and average readings for \u201cwildtype\u201d signal within each film as described in the main text. Normalized readings were compared to the wildtype reading by Dunnett\u2019s multiple t. Means significantly different at p > 0.05 indicated by \u201c*\u201d. D. Band I, NB extract. E. Band I, PC12 extract. F. Band II, NB extract. G. Band II, PC12 extract. Starkly visible qualitative differences were restricted to mutants M1, M4 and M6. The M1 mutants\u2019 predicted binding sites had lower affinity for AP2, GATA1, PuF, one of the two predicted SP1 transcription factor sites, and a downstream GC box. The M4 mutant is predicted to lose the shared GATA1/GATA2 site and the downstream SP1 site, The M6 mutant loses a predicted binding site for zeste homolog/TCERG1. In the case of the first two mutants, the major DNA-protein interaction product\u2019s migration was reduced compared to the wildtype oligomer pair\u2019s primary interaction product (Figure 4C). Analysis of relative migration rates for the wildtype oligomer pair showed that migration of the DNA-protein interaction products for M1 (lanes 2, 10) and M4 (lanes 5, 13) were significantly (p<0.05) reduced from the relative migration rate of wildtype oligomers (lanes 1, 9). The M6 mutation (lanes 7, 15) produced two major DNA-protein interactions in EMSA. The peak of the slower-running interaction was significantly (p<0.05) retarded in PC12 but not NB cells. Samples were processed and analyzed in triplicate and films densitometrically scanned. Densitometry results were normalized by subtracting the mean peak value for a single film and dividing by standard deviation for the film. For data presentation purposes, this was adjusted by subtracting the standardized value of \u201cwildtype\u201d, which sets \u201cwildtype\u201d value to 0 (Figure 4D\u2013G, Tables 3, 4). Adjusted data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s two-tailed t. Hedges g standard pairwise effect sizes [43], using mean square error for pooled standard deviation, were calculated for each variant vs. wildtype PRE (Tables 3, 4). Table 3. Adjusted/normalized ELISA and EMSA signals in NB cells and extractsTable 4. Adjusted/normalized ELISA and EMSA signals in PC12 cells and extractsAnalysis revealed differences between mutation effects on each band\u2019s signal strengths. Specifically, for band I (the slower-migrating band), the M1 mutant had significantly higher adjusted signal than wildtype in NB (Figure 4D, Table 3) nuclear extract. M2 in NB and PC12 extracts had significantly lower adjusted signal than did wildtype (Figure 4E, Table 4). For the dominant wildtype PRE EMSA band (band II), M3 and M7 had significantly higher signal than wildtype in NB (Figure 4F, Table 3) and PC12 (Figure 4G, Table 4) nuclear extracts, while M1 and M4 had significantly reduced signal in NB and PC12 extracts. Mutating the PRE in a reporter gene system produces specific functional differencesTo reveal connections between DNA-protein interactions and expression in mutations of the PRE, we constructed seven plasmids that mutated the PRE sequence identically to the mutant PRE oligomers. These cons-tructs were all based on p\u03b2XbB [17], which contains a promoterless CAT gene sequence under the control of an XbaI/BamHI fragment of the rhesus monkey APP gene promoter and 5\u2032-UTR, specifically \u2212309/+104, with +1 being the transcription start site (Figure 5A). Clones were transfected into PC12 and NB cell cultures as described herein. thumbnailFigure 5. ELISA of PRE variant CAT reporter clones in NB and PC12 cells. Functional differences of PRE mutant clones (M1-M7) from wildtype were assayed in NB and PC12 cells. A. p\u03b2XbB were constructed and transfected into NB or PC12 cell cultures as described in the main text. Cultures were harvested and analyzed by CAT ELISA. ELISA signals were normalized to \u201cwildtype\u201d values and subject to Dunnett\u2019s multiple t. Means significantly different at p > 0.05 indicated by \u201c*\u201d. B. ELISA of samples from NB cell cultures. C. ELISA of samples from PC12 cell cultures. Data presented is back-transformed from statistical analysis. Asymmetrical error bars and Dunnett\u2019s t limits are due to Box-Cox transformation, when used. ELISA results of the functional assay were adjusted for \u03b2-gal levels and made relative to wildtype = 1. Adjusted results were compared to wildtype by Dunnett\u2019s t, and Hedges g was calculated for each pairwise comparison (Tables 3, 4). Functional mutation effects in NB cells (Figure 5B, Table 3) were distinct from PC12 (Figure 5C, Table 4). In NB cells three mutants (M1, M5, and M6) had reduced reporter expression compared to wildtype, and mutant M3, had greater adjusted reporter expression than wildtype. In PC12 cells, mutants M1, M4, M5, and M6 had significantly lower CAT protein levels than wildtype. Mutating predicted locations of putative transcription factor sites in the PRE significantly alters reporter gene expression. These results were consistent between cell lines for the M1 and M5 mutants. Semiquantitative EMSA and ELISA specifically correlate by PRE mutantsWe compared EMSA and ELISA results by meta-analysis of pairwise Hedges g for ELISA and EMSA results vs. wildtype (Figure 6). For both NB and PC12 cells/ nuclear extracts, much weaker correlations were found between EMSA band I and ELISA signal (Figure 6A, B). Stronger correlations existed between EMSA band II and ELISA signal in both cell lines (Table 5; Figure 6C, D). Significance was estimated as chance that r \u2260 0 by bootstrap (500,000 repetitions). thumbnailFigure 6. EMSA vs. ELISA standardized effect sizes for PRE variants in NB and PC12 nuclear extracts and cultures. EMSA and ELISA results were used to generate Hedges pairwise g of comparisons of each mutant to wildtype PRE. Data was plotted with EMSA g on X axis and ELISA g on Y axis. Samples where both EMSA and ELISA signals were significantly different from wildtype at Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05 are indicated with corresponding mutant names. Correlations were bootstrapped (repeats = 100000), and frequency distributions of correlation coefficients are presented as insets. A. EMSA Band I vs. ELISA in NB extract/cells. B. EMSA Band I vs. ELISA in PC12 extract/cells. C. EMSA Band II vs. ELISA in NB extract/cells. D. EMSA Band II vs. ELISA in PC12 extract/cells. Table 5. Meta-analysis of PRE and mutant EMSA vs. ELISAThe percent overlap between the two bootstrap distributions within a single cell line was also calculated. The difference between correlations of EMSA I to ELISA vs. EMSA II to ELISA was more distinct in PC12 cells, with a 16% overlap between the two bootstrap distributions. In NB cells, the two bootstrap distributions overlapped by 34%. While there may be some indication of a direct relationship between EMSA band II signal and reporter ELISA results, we suggest caution in interpreting correlation meta-analysis. In addition to modest, at best, estimations of significance, EMSA bands I and II did not distinctly resolve on autoradiographs in many variants we studied, including wildtype (Figure 4). In addition, cell cultures used for ELISA and nuclear extracts used for EMSA did not come from the same specific cultures. Even with bootstrap estimation, they essentially represent correlations of averaged results from each assay. Nevertheless, we accept the possibility that some correspondence exists between altering the strength of the major DNA-protein interaction for the wildtype olig-omer pair (band II) and functional effects in reporter fusion assay. Mutating the PRE produces cell line-specific and inducible effects, as measured by EMSA To further investigate possible cell line/type-specific effects of the PRE, three mutants, specifically M1, M4, and M6, plus the wildtype PRE, were used as probes in EMSA with nuclear extracts from NB, PC12, human glioblastoma-astrocytoma (U373), HeLa or mouse embryo fibroblast (NIH3T3) cells. In addition, these oligomers were assayed with EMSA with nuclear extracts from HeLa, or NIH3T3 cells that had been subject to induction conditions, such as TPA treatment, serum starvation or induction with cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL6) or transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) (Figure 7). Three apparent bands, marked N (\u201cnull\u201d/\u201czero\u201d), I, and II, appeared among the various nuclear extracts, although no extract/mutant combination had all three bands. In nuclear extracts from NB cells (Figure 7, lanes 1\u20134), DNA-protein interactions were obtained as reported in 3.1. Wildtype oligomers produced a single strong interaction (lane I, band II). The M1 and M4 oligomer pairs each had an interaction that migrated more slowly than did the wildtype (lanes 2\u20133), while M6 had a mixed interaction, with bands that migrated both at the same rate as produced by wildtype and as by M1 (lane 4) oligomer pairs. The PC12 extracts (lanes 5\u20138) produced a pattern similar to that found with NB extracts, excepting that the DNA-protein interaction with M4 (lane 7) has a stronger \u201cleading\u201d edge to its band while the interaction with M6 has a weaker \u201ctrailing\u201d peak in the band doublet (lane 8). thumbnailFigure 7. EMSA of PRE and selected mutants in NB, PC12, HeLa, NIH3T3, and U373 nuclear extracts. Wildtype oligomers (lanes 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33) and oligomers for the M1 (lanes 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34), M4 (lanes 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35), and M6 (lanes 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36) were labeled with \u03b3\u221232P-ATP, incubated with NB (lanes 1\u20134) PC12 (lanes 5\u20138), U373 (lanes 9\u201312), HeLa (lanes 13\u201316), HeLa + TPA (lanes 17\u201320), NIH3T3 (lanes 21\u201324), NIH3T3 + serum restriction (lanes 25\u201328), NIH3T3 + IL6 (lanes 29\u201332), and NIH3T3 + TGF\u03b2 (lanes 33\u201336) nuclear extracts, and analyzed on nondenaturing PAGE, and gels subject to autoradiography. Interactions observed with U373 extracts (lanes 9\u201312) bore some resemblance to those observed with NB and PC12 nuclear extracts specifically for wildtype (lane 9) and M1 (lane 10). However, the M4 and M6 DNA-protein interactions (lanes 11, 12) were noticeably different from both NB and PC12. DNA-protein interactions seen with untreated HeLa nuclear extracts (lanes 13\u201316) did not apparently vary among PRE variants, but treatment of HeLa with TPA (lanes 17\u201320) resulted in a pattern of interactions that was more similar to those with NB and PC12 extracts. Untreated HeLa (lanes 13\u201316) DNA-protein interactions were unlike those found in the other cell lines surveyed. They had an additional band that migrated more slowly than seen for other cell line nuclear extracts. Interaction was very weak with the wildtype oligomer (lane 13), and it appeared as a doublet. The M1 mutant\u2019s interaction was a single band (lane 14), while M4 and M6 interactions were doublets (lanes 14\u201316). Serum starvation of NIH3T3 (lanes 25\u201328) may have slightly reduced interaction with the M4 mutant (lane 27) but appeared to have no other effect. Treatment of NIH3T3 with IL6 (lanes 29\u201332) increases DNA-protein interaction with the M6 oligomer (lane 32, band I). Of particular interest, treatment of NIH3T3 with TGF\u03b2 (lanes 33\u201336) brought about a dramatic shift in DNA-protein interaction bands for the wildtype PRE and all three mutants. While interaction was visibly weaker than for other NIH3T3 based extracts, it very closely resembled that seen for normal NB (lanes 1\u20134) and PC12 (lanes 2\u20138) extracts. The PRE is well-conserved within the human genome and throughout eutherian mammalsTo explore the possibility that the PRE is well-conserved, we examined genomic sequences identified or putatively identified as proximally upstream of the APP gene of 35 mammal species that were aligned by WebPrank[44] as described herein. Information of the alignment was calculated in bits [45,46] and averaged in a window of 100 nt, which roughly corresponds to the distance between nucleosomes in chromosomal DNA as described herein. Examination of the alignment as a whole revealed that the PRE was well conserved compared to immediately flanking sequences. Adding non-primate sequences to the alignment did not change average information content immediately around the PRE (Figure 8A), but average information content for the alignment dropped off significantly (p <0.05, Bonferroni adjusted for 4 comparisons) when on either side of the PRE. Information inversely expresses homogeneity, since 100% homogeneity at a given base is maximum possible score (2 bits) and equal distribution of all four bases would be 0 bits. thumbnailFigure 8. Multiple sequence alignment of APP upstream regions and test of molecular clock. DNA sequences from 20 mammal species were downloaded from GenBank and aligned with WebPrank as described in the main text. A. Average information content in a window of 100 nt and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for primates, euarchontoglires, boreoeutheria, eutheria, and mammals. B. Alignment was used as input for parsimony/FITCH combined phylogeny estimation as described in the main text. This produced a bifurcating non-ultrametric tree, although some branch lengths = 0. The tree was artificially rooted between marsupials and eutheria, and root-to-tip distances for each species calculated. Root-to-tip distances were compared to mean root-to-tip distance for the entire tree. Individual distances that differed from the mean distance (vertical solid line) \u00b1 the 95% (Bonferroni adjusted for 35 comparisons) confidence interval (vertical dashed lines) were counted as \u201csignificant\u201d. Distances that significantly exceeded the mean indicated by \u201c\u2020\u201d. Differences significantly lower than the mean indicated by \u201c*\u201d. Phylogenetic comparison of the alignment (\u2212326/+202 in the human sequence) led, as expected, to rejection of the molecular clock hypothesis (Figure 8B). DNA changes observed within the, admittedly short, region are unlikely to occur simply through neutral sequence drift. Of particular interest is that most of the primate sequences appeared to have a slower-than-typical rate of change vs. the overall tree while mouse and rat sequences had a faster-than-typical rate of change. Further detailed examination was done of the alignment region immediately surrounding the PRE (Figure 9). Alignment was guided by a tree (Figure 9A) based on current conventional mammal phylogeny [47-49], as suggested by the WebPrank protocol. Sequences were taxonomically weighted as described herein and homologies between the human sequence vs. other primates, euarchontoglires, boreoeutheria, eutheria, and all mammals were calculated for the aligned PRE, as were sequence logos [46] for these groups (Figure 9B\u2013F). The PRE remains fairly stable throughout the eutheria, with no less than 92.3% weighted homology to the human sequence (Table 6). Adding marsupials to the estimation reduces homology to 73.8%. Greater aggregate distance from primates also associates with lower specificity within the PRE (Table 6)\u2014total information content (essentially expressing sequence specificity in terms of bits) drops from 49.04 for primates (including humans) to 39.36 when all mammal sequences are considered (Table 6). Of particular interest, the overlapping SP1/PuF site within the PRE is also well conserved among placental mammals (Figure 9E). However, the site breaks down when marsupial sequences are included (Figure 9F). Marsupials also have a 9\u201310 base insertion within the PRE (Figure 9F\u2013G). thumbnailFigure 9.

Analysis of APP proximal promoter region multiple sequence alignmentDiscussionThe APP gene consists of 18 exons and spans more than 300 kilobases on human chromosome 21 [51]. We hypothesize that unusually high production of A\u03b2 may contribute to AD, and this aberrant A\u03b2 production can be a result of unusually high APP gene expression. The APP gene is a likely locus for sporadic, late-onset AD, the most common form of the disease [2,52,53]. Down syndrome patients invariably develop AD, which may be due to additional gene dose of the APP gene in the Down critical region of chromosome 21. In addition, cases of late-onset AD have increased plasma levels of the forms of A\u03b2 [54] specifically associated with the disease. Tissue and cell-type specific expression of the APP gene may also play a role in APP protein or A\u03b2-related pathogenesis. It is well established that mutations in the APP coding sequence can cause autosomal dominant early onset FAD [55]. Some analyses of the coding sequence [56] and the promoter [57] rejected other APP polymorphisms as predisposing to late onset AD (LOAD). However, there are reports of promoter polymorphisms that increase risk for AD in a non-autosomal fashion [58,59], particularly of two polymorphisms in the APP promoter associated with AD pedigrees [23]. In addition, the following results strongly implicate the role of promoter elements in AD. 1) In a genome screen of 292 sib-pairs with LOAD, Hardy\u2019s group identified 12 loci with lod-scores >1 including a region on chromosomes 21 [60]. 2) Using non-parametric linkage methods, Duke\u2019s group showed that a locus predisposing to LOAD might reside in this region of chromosome 21 [61]. 3) Levels of A\u03b2 correlate to cognitive decline in predementia and dementia [62]. 4) Genetic analysis of a case of DS due to non-disjunction suggested triplication of APP in the pathogenesis of AD in Down syndrome [63]. 5) Younkin\u2019s group analyzed plasma A\u03b2 in 180 first-degree relatives of LOAD patients and in 82 age-matched controls. This analysis showed highly significant increase in plasma A\u03b240/42 in the relatives as compared to controls [64,65]. Serial deletion analysis of the APP promoter has revealed several regulatory elements [14,17]. The APP promoter is regulated by several factors, including but not necessarily limited to nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin-l [20,21]. Copper depletion downregulates APP promoter activity [22]. Various groups have reported other transcriptional elements within the first 100 nt from TSS of the APP gene [19,34,66,67]. This includes regulation of APP promoter expression by two GC-elements [67], the zinc finger protein CTCF [66], and upstream stimulatory factor [19]. We previously reported discovering a 30 nt (\u221276/\u221247) fragment from a deletion series of the APP promoter with different effects depending upon cell line [27]. Our discovery was independently paralleled by other workers, who have noted a fragment of the APP promoter at \u221255/\u221233 by DNAse protection assay. This fragment was predicted to contain AP1 and AP4 binding sites, but both were experimentally excluded [15]. Furthermore, deletion of a \u221254/\u221242 fragment of the APP promoter resulted in reduced expression of reporter fusion clones [68]. In addition, deletion of a \u221277/\u221247 fragment resulted in reduced reporter fusion expression in rat primary embryonic hippocampal neurons [69], which was similar to our own observation of the effect of deleting the PRE in rodent cell lines and opposite what we observed in human cell lines [27]. This other work essentially concluded that USF was the responsible agent for regulation through this APP promoter fragment, although it did propose but not test a putative SP1 binding site. We do not dispute that USF may play an important role in APP proximal protein regulation but investigate the possibility that other factors and cofactors also operate on this sequence. We sought to more fully characterize the activity of the PRE as a component of the 5\u2032-flanking region of the APP gene. Transcription factor binding activity was studied by EMSA with human tissue nuclear extracts, including extracts from human brain, followed by EMSA in four different cell line nuclear extracts under different conditions of stimulation or induction. Binding of specific TFs was tested by competition EMSA and by antibody-supershift EMSA. We also used Southwestern blotting to estimate molecular weights of interaction partners with the PRE and compared these with candidate transcription factors. We have determined that the PRE has tissue specificity, showing greater DNA-protein interaction with brain and lung extracts than with liver or heart extracts. In addition, the PRE has cell line-specific DNA-protein interactions with cell nuclear extracts, differing among U937, HeLa, U373, PC12, NIH3T3 cell lines. These interactions are subject to reduction, elimination, or qualitative change by conditions such as hypoxia, SR, and induction with TPA or IFN-\u03b3), IL6, or TGF\u03b2. Our results suggest that the \u221276/\u221247 region binds to a protein that is upregulated in serum starvation, and downregulated in hypoxia. Because serum starvation contributes to the induction of apoptosis, these results suggest a role of the 30-nt proximal APP promoter element in enhanced apoptotic neuronal cell death. Competition EMSA and antibody-supershift EMSA confirmed predicted interactions between the PRE and AP2, while antibody-supershift EMSA confirmed interaction between the PRE and AP2, PuF, SP1, and USF2. Competition and supershift EMSA appear to contradict each other regarding SP1. Possible biological explanations could include sufficiently high affinity within the PRE for SP1 to overcome competition with the particular commercial probe used. High PRE-SP1 affinity could result in a \u201cnegative\u201d competition result but a positive supershift, since the supershift is meant to detect SP1 when bound to the target DNA. Alternatively, our supershift may be interacting with an SP1-like transcription factor that binds the PRE but has a lower affinity with the consensus SP1 site in the commercial competition oligomer. Southwestern blotting indicated possible interactions between the PRE and AP2, SP1, and USF2, among other TF. It also admitted the possibility of PRE-PuF dimer interaction. We mutated the PRE and highlighted a specific effect of the sequence that included the predicted PuF/SP1 binding site. Our mutant expression evidence tends to agree with our EMSA evidence. Of the mutants characterized, M1 was the most consistent in response across NB and PC12x cells and nuclear extracts. Specifically, semi-quantitative EMSA with M1 probe resulted in significant signal loss at the band position that corresponded closely to the major band of wildtype PRE EMSA in both NB and PC12 nuclear extracts. Likewise, M1 mutant promoter/reporter expression clones resulted in significantly reduced levels of CAT reporter protein in both NB and PC12 cells. The M1 mutant deleted the predicted PuF site and both predicted SP1 sites in the PRE. We note that M2 and M4 each also deleted a single predicted SP1 site, the specific site differing between M2 and M4. EMSA analysis of these two mutants showed that M4 consistently had reduced EMSA interaction at band II, while M2 did not. However, CAT reporter levels were not consistently altered between cell types. There-fore, our mutation analysis confirms our earlier conclusion that the PRE is most likely to function as a site of PuF and SP1 activity. Disruption of the shared PuF/SP1 site in our system resulted in reduced levels of reporter gene product, which appears to contradict part of our proposed model. However primary sequence disruption of the site would influence both PuF (repressive) and SP1 (stimulatory) interaction very strongly. In addition, disruption of the AP2 site also resulted in loss of EMSA signal, suggesting that the PRE may also function under induction as well as constitutively. Currently, two DNA sequence polymorphisms have been reported for the PRE, specifically rs200621906 and rs201592736 [37]. Each is predicted to alter potential TF binding sites within the PRE (Table 7). Of particular note, rs201592736 may interfere with the PuF site. In addition, potentially interesting sites were created, including glucocorticoid/progesterone receptor (GR/PR), NF1-like enkephalin nuclear transcription factor 1 (NKTF1) retinoic acid receptor \u03b3 (RAR\u03b3), and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1),. Glucocorticoid levels are well associated with AD risk [70]. Progesterone supplementation has been linked to more rapid age-related cognitive decline in post-menopausal women [71,72]. Elevated levels of enkephalin contribute to neurological impairment and tau phosphorylation in AD model animals [73]. Upregulation of enkephalin accompanied by upregulation of APP due to an SNP in the PRE may overwhelm natural defenses against neurodegeneration. RARs direct APP processing toward the non-pathogenic \u03b1 pathway [74], and it is conceivable that a feedback mechanism that results in RAR-mediated overproduction of APP in a natural PRE mutant may overwhelm this process. ZEB1 interacts with TGF\u03b2 [75], and TGF\u03b2 is implicated in AD pathogenesis [76,77]. The rs201592736 SNP approximates our M2 mutant, while rs200621906 approximates M4. Combining both polymorphisms approximates the TF deletion effects of M1, which showed significant Bonferroni-adjusted reductions in both EMSA and CAT reporter by meta-analysis. Population frequency of these SNPs has not been published, and it has not been yet determined if they occur as a haplotype or independently. It should be cautioned that, although they have interesting potential TF site changes, functional association with any disease state has also not been determined. Table 7. Natural SNP in the PREThe PRE is strongly conserved in placental mammals, particularly the PuF/SP1 overlapping site. In addition, this conservation occurs in a promoter region that has undergone significant non-neutral (i. e., non-molecular clock) change. In particular, primate and mouse/rat sequences diverge the most from each other in our root-to-tip ana-lysis, but with far less difference when considering the PRE, specifically. We propose that this particular short segment of the APP proximal regulatory region has been specifically maintained, as would be expected of an active promoter segment. We have previously stated that other AD-associated gene promoters, such as for APOE, have important differences between mouse and human [25]. Likewise, we have reported both differences and similarities between human and rat cell line responses to functional promoter deletion clones of the human MAPT promoter [26]. Such overall differences can be put to use in identifying potentially critical regions of similarity, such as the PRE within the APP promoter. Although two SNPs have been reported in the human PRE, it is unlikely, given their obscurity in the literature, that these would be common enough to explain a large proportion of sporadic AD. We propose that the majority of etiologically important PuF vs. SP1 disruption in the PRE would be due to environmental influences on epigenetic markers. The naturally-occurring SNPs could serve as a potential test bed, given their similarity in terms of TF site disruption to some of our synthetic mutants. It is potentially more interesting that the Puf/SP1 site consists primarily of GG and GGG sequences, which are particularly vulnerable to DNA oxidation [78]. While SP1 activity is sensitive to epigenetic DNA modification [79], and PuF operates in repair of DNA damage [80], relative effects of DNA oxidation upon each protein\u2019s activity as a transcription factor have not been established. Likewise, CpG dimers (sites of cytosine methylation) are immediately adjacent to the PuF/SP1 site. Thus, in our system, while disrupting both PuF and SP1 activity by primary sequence mutation may result in overall reduction in reporter levels, environmentally-induced epigenetic alterations to the shared target DNA sequence may favor SP1 stimulation over PuF inhibition. In light of the knowledge that overall PuF activity may be reduced in AD, we do not suggest that epigenetic modification of the PRE would be the sole cause of the disorder. Rather, it would contribute to disruption of normal APP gene expression that would accompany AD. Feedback mechanisms between APP and other misregulated AD associated genes may serve to also reduce PuF activity in concert with direct disruption of APP-PuF interaction. We admit that our current assignment of PuF and SP1 to active status within the PRE has not yet been directly tested. Mammalian PuF is associated with inhibition of invasive metastasis [81-84] and stimulation of normal cell proliferation [85,86]. PuF kinase activity was reduced in human brain in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Down syndrome [87]. Total APP mRNA is elevated in AD brain, specifically KPI(+) isoforms [88]. APP gene expression and SP1 activity are increased in aging primate brains [31]. SP1-DNA interaction and APP expression in mouse brains are increased in a latent fashion by early-life dietary administration of Pb [29]. We suggest an antagonistic role between PuF and SP1, specifically that PuF may serve to downregulate APP gene expression via the PRE in vivo, and increases in effective SP1 activity, due to increased SP1 levels, interference in PuF-DNA interaction at the PRE, or decrease in PuF levels, for example, may overwhelm PuF regulation. The PuF transcription factor/kinase was discovered in the context of inhibiting metastasis [28]. Such inhibition included through interaction with the MYC gene promoter [89,90]. Later, PuF was determined to also function as a kinase independently of its TF activity [91]. PuF TF activity was determined to not only act to inhibit metastasis, but to also operate in non-metastatic cell proliferation [85,86]. In addition to cell proliferative activity, PuF regulates insulin secretion from pancreas islet cells [92], providing another molecular link underlying the recently-proposed metabolic-cognitive syndrome that may unite metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders [93]. We propose that these aspects of PuF may prove important in understanding both AD pathogenesis and the possibility that a role may be played by APP gene products in oncogenesis. Of greater interest is that PuF has already been indirectly linked to AD before our work with the PRE. PuF interacts with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1 (CAMK2N1) [94]. CAMK2N1 is, itself, a potent inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2), which is a mediator of learning and memory [95]. CAMK2 is currently a target of several anti-AD drugs under investigation [96]. Of particular note is that the PRE exists within a DNAse I hypersensitive region [97], and PuF activity is modulated by the presence or absence of a DNAse I hypersensitive region [87]. Likewise, among its amazing variety of functions [98,99], the APP protein is a ferroxidase and activates ferroportin to export iron from neurons [100]. Iron chelation reduces APP protein levels through the APP mRNA 5\u2019-UTR [101], and this is reversed by iron supplementation. Conversely, overexpression of APP results in reduced iron content and increased oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma cells [102]. Although it has also been shown that abnormally high levels of iron accumulate in specific brain regions in AD, particularly within and around amyloid plaques [103], this is not paradoxical, since plaque-associated iron would be extracellular and could be in part due to overactivity of APP in iron transport. In addition, faulty iron metabolism has been strongly linked to cancer and neoplasia, specifically through ferroportin activity [104], and increased serum iron is associated with greater risk for oxidative damage to DNA [105]. Of particular interest for a possible oncology/APP association is that expression of the APP gene in response to iron chelators distinctly differed between neoplastic and normal cell lines [106]. In cancer patients, increased APP gene expression was more common in tumor tissue of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients than in non-cancerous matched tissue samples. More importantly, in those patients who had elevated APP expression, survival at 24 months was 48% vs. 82% for patients with non-elevated APP expression [107]. This suggests that PuF may exert anti-metastatic properties by, in part, altering levels of APP expression, reducing overall results of APP protein\u2019s ferroxidase activity and modulating cancer risk. Basal activity of the APP promoter is greatest in neural origin cell lines, and several promoter elements close to the PRE are important for this activity [108]. For example, the APP promoter contains binding sites for important TFs, such as purine-rich element binding protein-\u03b1 (PUR\u03b1) [109] and early growth response 1 (EGR1) [110]. Notably, there is a high expression of PUR\u03b1 and EGR1 in neurons during brain development and in the adult brain, and negative regulation of APP gene expression by PUR\u03b1 [109]. ConclusionsInterference with TF binding to the PRE in the context of the complete APP promoter could serve to deregulate APP production. Deletion of the PRE from a complete series of APP promoter clones resulted in a 3 to 4 fold gain of promoter activity in NB cells as measured by levels of reporter gene product [27]. While AP2 and USF2 (implicated in our antibody supershifts) are generally stimulatory factors, the normal function of PuF is usually inhibitory of pathogenic cell proliferation, specifically metastasis [83,84]. In addition to inhibiting metastasis, PuF serves to induce normal cell proliferation [83,84]. The APP protein, among its non-pathological functions, is active in the \u201cneuronal pruning\u201d stage of brain development, wherein neurons in the early brain are selectively removed after rapid proliferation [111]. In addition to neurogenesis, PuF homologues regulate early morphological development [112]. Thus, as PuF serves to stimulate non-pathogenic cell proliferation, and APP can act to reduce cell proliferation, it is reasonable to propose the possibility that PuF acts to downregulate APP expression under normal circumstances, and interference in PuF regulation through the PRE could serve to deregulate APP gene expression, potentially contributing to AD pathogenesis (Figure 10). A\u03b2 is a minority product of APP processing [113]. Therefore, increase in APP levels could raise A\u03b2 above a risk threshold for AD. A theoretical union of oncogenic and neurodegenerative models has been proposed in the latent early-life associated regulation (LEARn) model of idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders [38,39], expands and extends the \u201cn-hit\u201d model of pathogenesis commonly accepted in oncology to \u201csporadic\u201d neurodegenerative disorders. Given that the predicted PuF site may be structurally vulnerable to GG oxidation, and thus subject to the LEARn model, we conclude that our work suggests connections between processes that lead to cancer etiology and sporadic neurobiological disorders, both conceptually (LEARn vs. n-hit) and mechanistically (PuF regulation of APP vs. PuF regulation of metastasis). thumbnailFigure 10. Model of Antagonistic PuF vs. SP1 regulation of the APP gene and disruption in AD. A. Non-pathogenic APP expression, levels regulated by PuF. In normal brain, PuF would compete with SP1 at the PRE and result in normal levels of APP mRNA and protein. A\u03b2 would be restricted to non-pathogenic concentrations. B. Pathogenic APP expression resulting from disruption of PuF regulation of the PRE. Disruption of the PRE, such as through environmentally induced DNA oxidation at GG dimers, \u201c*\u201d, may reduce affinity of the PRE for PuF more severely than for SP1. Effective SP1 activity then serves to upregulate APP expression levels beyond a pathogenic threshold. MethodsReagents and enzymesUnless specifically noted otherwise, reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA) or Roche Life Science (Indianapolis, IN). Cell culturePC12 and NB cell lines were obtained from ATCC and cultured as described previously [114]. The plates were incubated in 5% CO2 in a 37\u00b0C incubator. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen/Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). PRE fragments and oligomersThe rhesus monkey APP promoter clone p\u03b2XbB [17] (Figure 11) was digested with restriction enzymes PvuII and XhoI and run on a 10% TAE-polyacrylamide gel. The cell type specific 30 nt (\u221276/\u221247) PRE [27] was purified and end-labeled with \u03b332P-ATP (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). In addition, oligomers corresponding to this sequence and its reverse complement were synthesized (Invitrogen) and similarly radiolabeled. The oligomer pair differs from the plasmid fragment in that it does not have a \u201cTCGA\u201d 5\u2032 overhang. This overhang was filled for wildtype and mutant (see \u201cSemiquantitative EMSA of mutant PRE oligomers\u2026\u201d, herein) synthetic double-stranded oligomers. thumbnailFigure 11. Clone p\u03b2XbB. A deletion series of 6kb of the APP promoter and 5\u2032-UTR was previously constructed [17]. Within this series, an XbaI/BamHI 408bp fragment of the APP proximal promoter and 5\u2032-UTR was inserted in the expression vector pBLCAT3 (Promega). This fragment contained the PRE. The clone was used as the base template for all mutagenesis described herein. Analysis of potential transcription factor binding sites on the PREThe TESS [40] and MatInspector [41] utilities were used to probe the TransFac database with the PRE sequence. EMSA of PRE fragments in human tissue nuclear extractsCell nuclei extracts from human brain, heart, liver, and lungs were prepared as previously described [115,116]. The assay was carried out with 40 pg of PRE from digestion of p\u03b2XbB (about 10,000 cpm) and 10 to 20 \u03bcg of nuclear extracts. Radioactive probe was incubated with human brain, heart, liver, or lung nuclear extracts in 24\u03bcl of EMSA-binding buffer (Active Motif, Carlsbad CA) at 6\u00b0\u20138\u00b0C for 40 minutes. The samples were mixed with loading dye and the products of the reaction were separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in 1 x TGE (50 mM Tris, 384 mM glycine, and 2 mM EDTA). The gel was dried and exposed to X-ray film for autoradiography. Free oligonucleotides ran at the bottom of the gel. Protein-DNA complexes were detected as mobility-retarded bands. EMSA in nuclear extracts from normal and variously stimulated PC12 and human U937 cells Nuclear extracts were obtained commercially (ActiveMotif). PRE oligomer pairs were annealed and radiolabeled as described herein. Radioactive oligomer pairs were incubated with nuclear extracts from PC12, hypoxic PC12, U937, and U937 stimulated with either IFN-\u03b3, TPA, or IFN-\u03b3 + TPA. In addition, one sample was incubated with U937 nuclear extracts and 200x molar excess of unlabeled PRE oligomer pairs. Reaction mixtures were analyzed on nondenaturing PAGE and the gel used for autoradiography. Competition EMSA in nuclear extracts from NB and HeLa cellsCell nuclear extracts from NB and either HeLa cultures or HeLa treated with TPA were obtained commercially (Active Motif). Oligomer pairs for the PRE were annealed and radiolabeled as described herein. Nuclear extracts and oligomer pairs were incubated as described herein, except that some individual samples were incubated with 200x molar excess of unlabeled oligomer pairs. NB extracts were either uncompeted or competed against unlabeled PRE or commercially-obtained oligomer pairs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) known to bind AP1, AP2, SP1, or USF1. EMSA in unstimulated HeLa extracts was not subject to competition. Extracts from TPA-stimulated HeLa were either uncompeted or competed against unlabeled PRE or commercially-obtained oligomers known\n\t\t\t", "question_id": "4", "question_str": "Depletion of which metal results in lower activity of the APP gene promoter?", "answer_options": {"answer_id": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"], "answer_str": ["BACE1", "Copper", "pBLCAT3", "408nt", "TFs"]}, "correct_answer_id": "2", "correct_answer_str": "Copper"}, {"topic_id": "1", "topic_name": "Alzheimer_Task", "test_id": "4", "document_id": "4", "document_str": "\nBMC Genomics | Full text | PuF, an antimetastatic and developmental signaling protein, interacts with the Alzheimer's amyloid-beta precursor protein via a tissue-specific proximal regulatory element (PRE)Top Abstract Background Results Discussion Conclusions Methods Abbreviations Competing interests Authors\u2019 contributions Acknowledgements References \ufffc\ufffc BMC GenomicsVolume 14Viewing optionsAbstract Full text PDF (1.7MB) Associated materialPubMed record About this articleReaders' comments Related literatureCited byGoogle blog searchOther articles by authorson Google Scholar Lahiri DK Maloney B Rogers JT Ge YW on PubMed Lahiri DK Maloney B Rogers JT Ge YW Related articles/pageson Googleon Google Scholaron PubMedToolsDownload references Download XMLEmail to a friend Order reprintsPost a comment Share this articleTweet More options...

Formula display:\ufffcAbstractBackgroundAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is intimately tied to amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide. Extraneuronal brain plaques consisting primarily of A\u03b2 aggregates are a hallmark of AD. Intraneuronal A\u03b2 subunits are strongly implicated in disease progression. Protein sequence mutations of the A\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) account for a small proportion of AD cases, suggesting that regulation of the associated gene (APP) may play a more important role in AD etiology. The APP promoter possesses a novel 30 nucleotide sequence, or \u201cproximal regulatory element\u201d (PRE), at \u221276/\u221247, from the +1 transcription start site that confers cell type specificity. This PRE contains sequences that make it vulnerable to epigenetic modification and may present a viable target for drug studies. We examined PRE-nuclear protein interaction by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and PRE mutant EMSA. This was followed by functional studies of PRE mutant/reporter gene fusion clones. ResultsEMSA probed with the PRE showed DNA-protein interaction in multiple nuclear extracts and in human brain tissue nuclear extract in a tissue-type specific manner. We identified transcription factors that are likely to bind the PRE, using competition gel shift and gel supershift: Activator protein 2 (AP2), nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase/metastatic inhibitory protein (PuF), and specificity protein 1 (SP1). These sites crossed a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). EMSA with PRE mutants and promoter/reporter clone transfection analysis further implicated PuF in cells and extracts. Functional assays of mutant/reporter clone transfections were evaluated by ELISA of reporter protein levels. EMSA and ELISA results correlated by meta-analysis. ConclusionsWe propose that PuF may regulate the APP gene promoter and that AD risk may be increased by interference with PuF regulation at the PRE. PuF is targeted by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1, which also interacts with the integrins. These proteins are connected to vital cellular and neurological functions. In addition, the transcription factor PuF is a known inhibitor of metastasis and regulates cell growth during development. Given that APP is a known cell adhesion protein and ferroxidase, this suggests biochemical links among cell signaling, the cell cycle, iron metabolism in cancer, and AD in the context of overall aging. Keywords: Amyloid precursor protein; Alzheimer\u2019s disease; Cancer; Gene regulation; Gene transcription; Iron; Latency; nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase; Oncogenesis; PuF; SP1; Specificity protein 1; Transcription factorBackgroundA diagnostic feature of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is aggregation of toxic amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) into extracellular plaques, suspected of causing or contributing to disease progression [1,2]. In addition, intracellular A\u03b2 has been implicated as having a pathological role in AD and Down syndrome [3], and A\u03b2 may function as a transcription factor (TF) [4,5]. A\u03b2 is cleaved from a larger precursor protein (APP) by a process involving two secretase enzymes, \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase [2]. Hyperphosphorylated \u03c4 protein and \u03b1-synuclein also have a likely role in AD etiology [6-8], and apolipoprotein E (APOE) is linked to a large proportion of cases of AD both by genetic [9,10] and cholesterol-related functional studies [11]. We hypothesize that unusually high production of A\u03b2 significantly contributes to AD, and this aberrant A\u03b2 production can result from unusually high APP gene (APP) expression, particularly in a tissue and cell-type specific manner. Several groups have studied the 5\u2032-flanking region of the APP gene, including its promoter [12-16]. Serial deletion analysis has shown that the APP promoter [14,17] and 5\u2032-UTR [18] contain several regulatory elements that are likely to modulate transcriptional activity. In addition to proximal regulatory regions, two upstream sequences have been identified that regulate the gene\u2019s expression [14], including one that has been shown to generally stimulate APP production [19]. The APP promoter is regulated by a variety of factors. It can be stimulated by nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin-l [20,21], and copper depletion downregulates its activity [22]. A link between APP gene regulation and pathologies such as AD has been shown, for example, by characterization of two APP promoter polymorphisms associated with the pathogenesis of some forms of AD [23]. The more upstream of these two polymorphic sites may function as a target site for A\u03b2 acting as a transcription factor [4,5]. Our group has examined regulatory regions of important AD-associated genes, including APOE[24,25] and microtubule-associated protein \u03c4 (MAPT) [26]. We have also previously characterized a deletion series of the APP promoter in eight different cell lines from five different tissue types in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter construct [27]. We discovered that a novel 30 nucleotide (nt) sequence of \u221276 to \u221247 from the +1 transcription start site (TSS) had differential effect depending upon cell line. In human kidney epithelial cells, deletion of this element resulted in 50-fold reduction of CAT reporter gene activity. In human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma (NB) cells, deletion resulted in a 3 to 4-fold gain of reporter gene activity, the greatest NB cell expression for all clones of the deletion series. We thus termed this region the \u201cproximal regulatory element\u201d (PRE) of the APP gene. We examined the nature of DNA-protein interaction with this DNA fragment by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA or gel shift). Notably, use of the PRE as a probe in EMSA showed evidence of DNA-protein interaction with this sequence in multiple cell line nuclear extracts and in mouse brain tissue nuclear extract [27]. However, the specific nature of nuclear proteins that interact with the PRE in different cell types was not determined at that time. We continue our work on the PRE by exploring specific DNA-protein interactions in EMSA, competition EMSA, and antibody-supershift EMSA. Functional effects were measured by creation of a library of mutant PRE sequences within a previously constructed [17]APP-CAT fusion clone. While we had previously shown that the PRE interacts with nuclear proteins in a tissue-type specific manner, we herein identified TFs that were likely bind to the PRE, specifically activator protein 2 (AP2), nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase/metastatic inhibitory protein (PuF), and specificity protein 1 (SP1). We also characterized quantitative and qualitative effects of mutating the PRE vs. DNA-protein interaction in EMSA vs. both NB and rat neuronal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and cell nuclear extracts. Functional assays of PRE mutation effects were performed by transiently transfecting the mutant-CAT clones into human neuroblastoma and rat neuronal pheochromocytoma cell cultures. We discovered specific, significant mutation-dependent function differences. We compared the EMSA results to effects of the same mutations in functional mutant-CAT clone transfection assays. Altering the PRE\u2019s ability to bind TF corresponded to functional changes in promoter activity in a cell line-specific manner. We determined that PuF and SP1 are candidates for regulation of the APP gene through the PRE. PuF\u2019s better-known function is as an inhibitor of metastasis [28]. SP1 activity in APP regulation has already been well demonstrated [29-33]. SP1 sites have been located in both the promoter [13,32,34] and 5\u2032-UTR portions of the APP 5\u2032-flanking region [35,36]. Our data led us to propose that SP1 and PuF act antagonistically through the PRE, with SP1 stimulating and PuF repressing APP transcription. These two TF sites can be subject to natural variation in the human genome, as they cross a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [37]. The PRE sequence contains sites for DNA methylation and oxidation, suggesting the site may be vulnerable to environmentally-mediated epigenetic modification. Should such interference with PuF regulation of APP increase risk of AD, it would be another similarity between etiology of sporadic/idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders and oncogenesis, extending our previous work in developing the latent early-life associated regulation (LEARn) model [38,39] of idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders. ResultsPutative transcription factor sites within the PREThe PRE with an additional 10nt flanking sequence at either end was used with TESS [40] and MatInspector [41] to probe the TransFac database [42]. Restricting predicted sites to mammal TF matrices and eliminating redundant sites resulted in predicted affinities with several transcription factors (Table 1), including AP2, GATA binding proteins 1 (GATA1) and 2 (GATA2), two GC boxes, paired box gene 4-a (Pax4a), PuF, Epstein-Barr virus transcription factor R (R), SP1, and transcription elongation regulator 1 (mammal homologue to zeste, TCERG1). Truncated upstream stimulatory factor (USF)1 and USF2 sites were also found at the 3\u2032-end of the PRE. The GC box is associated with the binding of several transcription factors, including SP1, basic transcription element binding protein (BTEB)1, BTEB2, and msh homeobox 1 (Msx1). Table 1. Predicted TF sites in the PREDNA-protein interaction of the PRE by EMSA varies among tissue types and cell line conditions To investigate cell type specificity of PRE-protein interactions, we used the PRE fragment in EMSA with nuclear extracts from PC12 and human cervical epithelial (HeLa), SK-N-BE neuroblastoma (NB), and histiocytic lymphoma (U937) cells (Figure 1A\u2013C) and with nuclear extracts from human tissues (Figure 1D). PC12 extracts (Figure 1A) were obtained from both normal and hypoxic cells (lanes 1\u20132). U937 extracts (Figure 1A) included nuclei from untreated cells and from cells treated with interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or TPA + IFN-\u03b3 (lanes 3\u20137). In addition, to test specificity of PRE binding with untreated U937 extracts, we also competed the PRE/U937 EMSA against 200x molar excess unlabeled PRE fragment (lane 5). Nuclear extract EMSA showed definite interaction between the PRE and both PC12 and U937 extracts. This interaction was competed away with excess PRE in U937 extracts. DNA-protein interactions could be altered by specific treatment of cells from which extracts were taken. Hypoxia greatly reduced the observed interaction in PC12 extracts (lane 2). Treatment with the cytokine IFN-\u03b3 may have slightly increased interaction in U937 extracts (lane 4), but TPA treatment seems to have produced a stronger result (lane 6). Combined TPA+IFN-\u03b3 treatment (lane 7) reduced DNA-protein interaction levels, suggesting that more than one pathway may be involved in interaction with the PRE and that these interactions may compete with each other. thumbnailFigure 1. EMSA in stimulated and unstimulated cell culture nuclear extracts and vs. various transcription factor binding oligomers. A. Radiolabeled PRE was incubated with PC12 or U937 nuclear extracts. PC12 extracts were either normal (lane 1) or from cells subject to hypoxia (lane 2). U937 extracts were either normal (lanes 3, 6) or from INF-\u03b3 induced (lane 4), TPA-induced (lane 6), or TPA + INF-\u03b3 induced cells (lane 7). In addition, one sample of normal U937 extract was incubated both with labeled and 200x molar excess of unlabeled PRE (lane 5). Arrows indicate major DNA-protein interactions. B, C. The PRE fragment from plasmid p\u03b2XbB was radiolabeled and incubated in NB or HeLa cell nuclear extracts with or without 200x molar excess competition against oligomers known to bind specific transcription factors. DNA-protein interactions are indicated with arrows. B. NB cell nuclear extracts. No competition (lane 1), competition vs. unlabeled PRE (lane 2), competition vs. unlabeled oligomers that bind AP1 (lane 3), AP2 (lane 4), SP1 (lane 5), or USF1 (lane 6). C. HeLa (lane 1) or TPA-stimulated HeLa (lanes 2\u20136) nuclear extracts. Reactions were subjected to no competition (lanes 1\u20132) competition vs. 200x molar excess of unlabeled PRE fragment (lane 3), AP1-binding oligomer (lane 4), AP2-binding oligomer, or USF-binding oligomer (lane 5). D. EMSA of the PRE in four human tissue nuclear extracts. The DNA fragment corresponding to the PRE (\u221276/-47) was purified from plasmid p\u03b2XbB, radiolabeled, and incubated in nuclear extracts from human lung (lane 1), liver (lane 2), heart (lane 3), or brain (lane 4). DNA-protein interaction band is indicated by arrow. Unbound probe ran at the bottom of the gel (not shown). To narrow down candidate transcription factors predicted by TESS we conducted EMSA with 200x molar excess of unlabeled oligomer pairs known to bind the transcription factors activator protein 1 (AP1), AP2, and SP1, respectively. In addition, to demonstrate that the truncated USF1 site at the 3\u2032-end of the PRE is not active, we competed against an unlabeled commercial oligomer pair known to bind USF1 (Figure 1B, C). Two assays were carried out under the same conditions, one each with nuclear extracts from NB (Figure 1B) and HeLa (Figure 1C) cells, respectively. In NB extracts, competition against AP1, SP1, and USF1 binding oligomer pairs (lanes 3, 5, 6) showed no difference with the uncompeted lane sample (lane 1). Competition with unlabeled PRE eliminated DNA-protein interactions (lane 2), while competition with AP2-binding oligomer pair reduced but did not eliminate interaction, suggesting that PRE interaction in neuronal cells may operate through more than one pathway or at least with more than one potential transcription factor. Competition EMSA in HeLa extracts was in TPA-treated extracts (Figure 1C, lanes 2\u20136). Comparing untreated HeLa nuclear extracts with TPA-treated extracts revealed that TPA induction changed DNA-protein interactions with the PRE (Figure 1C, lanes 1\u20132). Competition with the PRE nearly eliminated DNA-protein interaction (lane 3). Competition with oligomer pairs that bind AP1 (lane 4) and AP2 (lane 5) partially reduced DNA-protein interaction. Competition with the USFl-binding oligomer pairs showed little difference to uncompeted TPA-treated extracts (lane 6). These results indicate that the PRE may interact with AP2, at the very least, but AP2 is neither the sole interaction partner for the PRE in neuronal cells nor under phorbol ester induction. To directly explore tissue specificity of PRE interaction with factors present specifically in whole-tissue human organs in addition to cell cultures, we also carried out EMSA of the PRE fragment in human brain, heart, liver, and lung nuclear extracts. Two of the four extracts tested formed DNA-protein complexes with the PRE, specifically lung and brain extracts (Figure 1D lanes 1, 4). This suggests that the PRE is likely to have tissue-specific function in vivo, in addition to what may be suggested by cell culture results, and that the brain is at least one center of such affinity. DNA-protein interactions in NB nuclear extracts is TF specific by gel supershift EMSAFor further information on specific nuclear factors that would interact with the PRE, we performed supershift EMSA with radiolabeled PRE oligomer pairs in NB nuclear extracts (Figure 2). Extracts were either untreated or co-incubated with antibodies against nuclear factors AP1, AP2, PuF, SP1, or combined AP2 + PuF. As negative controls, we incubated NB extracts with labeled PRE oligomer pairs and antibodies against USF1 or USF2. thumbnailFigure 2. Antibody supershift EMSA of PRE in NB nuclear extracts. Radiolabeled PRE oligomer pairs were incubated with NB cell nuclear extracts (lane 1) and with extracts in the presence of antibodies against transcription factors AP1 (lane 2), AP2 (lane 3), PuF (lane 4), AP2 + PuF (lane 5), SP1 (lane 6), USF1 (lane 7), or USF2 (lane 8). Arrows indicate seven major bands. Incubation of PRE oligomers with NB extracts was not altered by co-incubation with anti-AP1 (lanes 1\u20132), primarily consisting of a single band. As predicted, anti-AP2 and anti-PuF each altered binding of the PRE with NB extracts (lanes 3\u20134). In addition to reducing the major DNA-protein interaction of un-competed PRE (band III), new DNA-protein interactions (bands V and VI) became visible when anti-AP2 was co-incubated. Co-incubation with anti-PuF produced a similar pattern to anti-AP2, with an additional band (IV). Of particular interest is that co-incubation with both antibodies reduced DNA-protein interaction more than did incubation with either antibody alone, and completely eliminated the interaction at band III (lane 5). Co-incubation with anti-SP1 produced a more classic \u201cshift\u201d response (lane 6, band I). Co-incubation with anti-USF1 (lane 7) did not result in any changes. Co-incubation with anti-USF2, on the other hand, produced a response similar to that found with anti-AP2 or anti-PuF. In addition, band II appears, but this band may also be already present but masked by the breadth of band III in untreated reactions. Close examination of lane I indicates that the interaction at band VI may also be present in untreated reactions. Bands IV and V, on the other hand, do not appear when the PRE is incubated with NB extracts in the absence of antibody or in the presence of AP1, SP1, or USF1 antibodies. These results indicate that AP2, PuF, SP1, and USF2 are all potential candidates for interaction with the PRE. Southwestern blotting with the PRE shows different DNA-protein interactions among different cell lines and conditions To ascertain sizes of proteins that participate in some of the observed interactions with the PRE, we performed southwestern blotting with nuclear extracts from NB, PC12, HeLa and TPA-treated HeLa cells (Figure 3). Probing with radiolabeled PRE oligomer pairs revealed that DNA-protein interactions varied among extracts and were subject to induction. NB nuclear extract (lane 1) had major interactions at approximately 92, 33, 32, and 23 kDa (the last an extrapolation outside the range of the size standard). In addition, faint bands appeared at approximately 64, 51, and 39 kDa. The PC12 nuclear extract (lane 2) also had a 33 kDa/32 kDa doublet but lacked a 92 kDa interaction. Instead, an interaction at approximately 60 kDa appears. thumbnailFigure 3. Southwestern blot of PRE vs. cell line nuclear extracts. Nuclear extracts from cell lines NB (lane 1), PC12 (lane 2), HeLa (lane 3), and HeLa treated with TPA (lane 4) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane was probed with radiolabeled PRE oligomers. Blot photographs were size-equalized by use of the same lot of protein standards. Major bands are indicated with solid arrows. Minor bands are indicated with dotted-line arrows. PC12 also had weaker interactions at 92, 39, and 23 kDa. HeLa nuclear extract (lane 3) shared interactions at approximately 92 and between 33 and 32 kDa, with fainter bands at 64, 60, 51, 39, and 23 kDa. Induction of HeLa with TPA (lane 4) resolved the 33/32 kDa band into a doublet and reduced the strength of weaker interactions. Comparison of the observed southwestern bands with molecular weights of predicted transcription factors suggests the possibility that several of the predicted candidate transcription factors may bind to the PRE (Table 2). Table 2. Putative TF sites from southwestern blot based on estimated kDa of bandsThese comparisons were based on a \u00b110% adjustment to the calculated southwestern band kDa. Of the potential DNA-TF interactions, several appear for all nuclear extracts. These are AP2, Msx1, and USF1. A few are unique to human neuroblastoma nuclear extracts, specifically Pax4a, USF2, and BTEB2. There is no signal that can be assigned to PuF subunits, which would be around 17kDa in weight. This may be an artifact of the specific gel\u2019s polyacrylamide percentage. However, the band VI/VII doublet could correspond to PuF dimers. In general, the southwestern does not exclude conclusions of our EMSA-based assays. Mutating the PRE alters DNA-protein interactionTo more specifically determine those sequences within the PRE that participate in gene regulation, we had synthesized a series of oligomer pairs that deleted one or more of the transcription factor sites we predicted to be in the PRE. These mutant oligomers were used for EMSA (Figure 4A, B) in both NB (lanes 1\u20138) and PC12 (lanes 9\u201316) cell nuclear extracts. Mutations resulted in both quantitative and qualitative alterations in DNA-protein interaction as determined by EMSA. Densitometry scans revealed that, at least for some mutants, such as M6, two partially overlapping bands appeared (Figure 4A, lane 7), and the wildtype oligomer pair has an extended trailing end to its peak, suggesting that wildtype binding is to more than one interaction partner. Semi-quantitative analysis, therefore, was done for all samples on each individual peak (division between peaks shown by dashed line in Figure 4A-C). thumbnailFigure 4. EMSA of wildtype and mutant PRE oligomers and semiquantitative analysis of EMSA. Wildtype and mutant PRE oligomers (M1-M7) were incubated with A. NB and B. PC12 nuclear extracts were analyzed on non-denaturing PAGE. Samples were analyzed in triplicate; figure presents a representative gel for each. Bands \u201cI\u201d and \u201cII\u201d as described in the main text are indicated. Dashed line indicates division made between band I and band II for densitometry purposes. C. Cross section of EMSA lanes. ImageJ software was used to evaluate densitometry of scanned films from EMSA of NB and PC12 nuclear extracts with various PRE variant oligomer pairs. Profiles of peaks for each PRE variant from a typical gel are shown. Dashed line indicates boundary between band I and band II for densitometry purposes. D\u2013G. Densitometry readings for EMSA films were normalized to standard deviations and average readings for \u201cwildtype\u201d signal within each film as described in the main text. Normalized readings were compared to the wildtype reading by Dunnett\u2019s multiple t. Means significantly different at p > 0.05 indicated by \u201c*\u201d. D. Band I, NB extract. E. Band I, PC12 extract. F. Band II, NB extract. G. Band II, PC12 extract. Starkly visible qualitative differences were restricted to mutants M1, M4 and M6. The M1 mutants\u2019 predicted binding sites had lower affinity for AP2, GATA1, PuF, one of the two predicted SP1 transcription factor sites, and a downstream GC box. The M4 mutant is predicted to lose the shared GATA1/GATA2 site and the downstream SP1 site, The M6 mutant loses a predicted binding site for zeste homolog/TCERG1. In the case of the first two mutants, the major DNA-protein interaction product\u2019s migration was reduced compared to the wildtype oligomer pair\u2019s primary interaction product (Figure 4C). Analysis of relative migration rates for the wildtype oligomer pair showed that migration of the DNA-protein interaction products for M1 (lanes 2, 10) and M4 (lanes 5, 13) were significantly (p<0.05) reduced from the relative migration rate of wildtype oligomers (lanes 1, 9). The M6 mutation (lanes 7, 15) produced two major DNA-protein interactions in EMSA. The peak of the slower-running interaction was significantly (p<0.05) retarded in PC12 but not NB cells. Samples were processed and analyzed in triplicate and films densitometrically scanned. Densitometry results were normalized by subtracting the mean peak value for a single film and dividing by standard deviation for the film. For data presentation purposes, this was adjusted by subtracting the standardized value of \u201cwildtype\u201d, which sets \u201cwildtype\u201d value to 0 (Figure 4D\u2013G, Tables 3, 4). Adjusted data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s two-tailed t. Hedges g standard pairwise effect sizes [43], using mean square error for pooled standard deviation, were calculated for each variant vs. wildtype PRE (Tables 3, 4). Table 3. Adjusted/normalized ELISA and EMSA signals in NB cells and extractsTable 4. Adjusted/normalized ELISA and EMSA signals in PC12 cells and extractsAnalysis revealed differences between mutation effects on each band\u2019s signal strengths. Specifically, for band I (the slower-migrating band), the M1 mutant had significantly higher adjusted signal than wildtype in NB (Figure 4D, Table 3) nuclear extract. M2 in NB and PC12 extracts had significantly lower adjusted signal than did wildtype (Figure 4E, Table 4). For the dominant wildtype PRE EMSA band (band II), M3 and M7 had significantly higher signal than wildtype in NB (Figure 4F, Table 3) and PC12 (Figure 4G, Table 4) nuclear extracts, while M1 and M4 had significantly reduced signal in NB and PC12 extracts. Mutating the PRE in a reporter gene system produces specific functional differencesTo reveal connections between DNA-protein interactions and expression in mutations of the PRE, we constructed seven plasmids that mutated the PRE sequence identically to the mutant PRE oligomers. These cons-tructs were all based on p\u03b2XbB [17], which contains a promoterless CAT gene sequence under the control of an XbaI/BamHI fragment of the rhesus monkey APP gene promoter and 5\u2032-UTR, specifically \u2212309/+104, with +1 being the transcription start site (Figure 5A). Clones were transfected into PC12 and NB cell cultures as described herein. thumbnailFigure 5. ELISA of PRE variant CAT reporter clones in NB and PC12 cells. Functional differences of PRE mutant clones (M1-M7) from wildtype were assayed in NB and PC12 cells. A. p\u03b2XbB were constructed and transfected into NB or PC12 cell cultures as described in the main text. Cultures were harvested and analyzed by CAT ELISA. ELISA signals were normalized to \u201cwildtype\u201d values and subject to Dunnett\u2019s multiple t. Means significantly different at p > 0.05 indicated by \u201c*\u201d. B. ELISA of samples from NB cell cultures. C. ELISA of samples from PC12 cell cultures. Data presented is back-transformed from statistical analysis. Asymmetrical error bars and Dunnett\u2019s t limits are due to Box-Cox transformation, when used. ELISA results of the functional assay were adjusted for \u03b2-gal levels and made relative to wildtype = 1. Adjusted results were compared to wildtype by Dunnett\u2019s t, and Hedges g was calculated for each pairwise comparison (Tables 3, 4). Functional mutation effects in NB cells (Figure 5B, Table 3) were distinct from PC12 (Figure 5C, Table 4). In NB cells three mutants (M1, M5, and M6) had reduced reporter expression compared to wildtype, and mutant M3, had greater adjusted reporter expression than wildtype. In PC12 cells, mutants M1, M4, M5, and M6 had significantly lower CAT protein levels than wildtype. Mutating predicted locations of putative transcription factor sites in the PRE significantly alters reporter gene expression. These results were consistent between cell lines for the M1 and M5 mutants. Semiquantitative EMSA and ELISA specifically correlate by PRE mutantsWe compared EMSA and ELISA results by meta-analysis of pairwise Hedges g for ELISA and EMSA results vs. wildtype (Figure 6). For both NB and PC12 cells/ nuclear extracts, much weaker correlations were found between EMSA band I and ELISA signal (Figure 6A, B). Stronger correlations existed between EMSA band II and ELISA signal in both cell lines (Table 5; Figure 6C, D). Significance was estimated as chance that r \u2260 0 by bootstrap (500,000 repetitions). thumbnailFigure 6. EMSA vs. ELISA standardized effect sizes for PRE variants in NB and PC12 nuclear extracts and cultures. EMSA and ELISA results were used to generate Hedges pairwise g of comparisons of each mutant to wildtype PRE. Data was plotted with EMSA g on X axis and ELISA g on Y axis. Samples where both EMSA and ELISA signals were significantly different from wildtype at Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05 are indicated with corresponding mutant names. Correlations were bootstrapped (repeats = 100000), and frequency distributions of correlation coefficients are presented as insets. A. EMSA Band I vs. ELISA in NB extract/cells. B. EMSA Band I vs. ELISA in PC12 extract/cells. C. EMSA Band II vs. ELISA in NB extract/cells. D. EMSA Band II vs. ELISA in PC12 extract/cells. Table 5. Meta-analysis of PRE and mutant EMSA vs. ELISAThe percent overlap between the two bootstrap distributions within a single cell line was also calculated. The difference between correlations of EMSA I to ELISA vs. EMSA II to ELISA was more distinct in PC12 cells, with a 16% overlap between the two bootstrap distributions. In NB cells, the two bootstrap distributions overlapped by 34%. While there may be some indication of a direct relationship between EMSA band II signal and reporter ELISA results, we suggest caution in interpreting correlation meta-analysis. In addition to modest, at best, estimations of significance, EMSA bands I and II did not distinctly resolve on autoradiographs in many variants we studied, including wildtype (Figure 4). In addition, cell cultures used for ELISA and nuclear extracts used for EMSA did not come from the same specific cultures. Even with bootstrap estimation, they essentially represent correlations of averaged results from each assay. Nevertheless, we accept the possibility that some correspondence exists between altering the strength of the major DNA-protein interaction for the wildtype olig-omer pair (band II) and functional effects in reporter fusion assay. Mutating the PRE produces cell line-specific and inducible effects, as measured by EMSA To further investigate possible cell line/type-specific effects of the PRE, three mutants, specifically M1, M4, and M6, plus the wildtype PRE, were used as probes in EMSA with nuclear extracts from NB, PC12, human glioblastoma-astrocytoma (U373), HeLa or mouse embryo fibroblast (NIH3T3) cells. In addition, these oligomers were assayed with EMSA with nuclear extracts from HeLa, or NIH3T3 cells that had been subject to induction conditions, such as TPA treatment, serum starvation or induction with cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL6) or transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) (Figure 7). Three apparent bands, marked N (\u201cnull\u201d/\u201czero\u201d), I, and II, appeared among the various nuclear extracts, although no extract/mutant combination had all three bands. In nuclear extracts from NB cells (Figure 7, lanes 1\u20134), DNA-protein interactions were obtained as reported in 3.1. Wildtype oligomers produced a single strong interaction (lane I, band II). The M1 and M4 oligomer pairs each had an interaction that migrated more slowly than did the wildtype (lanes 2\u20133), while M6 had a mixed interaction, with bands that migrated both at the same rate as produced by wildtype and as by M1 (lane 4) oligomer pairs. The PC12 extracts (lanes 5\u20138) produced a pattern similar to that found with NB extracts, excepting that the DNA-protein interaction with M4 (lane 7) has a stronger \u201cleading\u201d edge to its band while the interaction with M6 has a weaker \u201ctrailing\u201d peak in the band doublet (lane 8). thumbnailFigure 7. EMSA of PRE and selected mutants in NB, PC12, HeLa, NIH3T3, and U373 nuclear extracts. Wildtype oligomers (lanes 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33) and oligomers for the M1 (lanes 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34), M4 (lanes 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35), and M6 (lanes 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36) were labeled with \u03b3\u221232P-ATP, incubated with NB (lanes 1\u20134) PC12 (lanes 5\u20138), U373 (lanes 9\u201312), HeLa (lanes 13\u201316), HeLa + TPA (lanes 17\u201320), NIH3T3 (lanes 21\u201324), NIH3T3 + serum restriction (lanes 25\u201328), NIH3T3 + IL6 (lanes 29\u201332), and NIH3T3 + TGF\u03b2 (lanes 33\u201336) nuclear extracts, and analyzed on nondenaturing PAGE, and gels subject to autoradiography. Interactions observed with U373 extracts (lanes 9\u201312) bore some resemblance to those observed with NB and PC12 nuclear extracts specifically for wildtype (lane 9) and M1 (lane 10). However, the M4 and M6 DNA-protein interactions (lanes 11, 12) were noticeably different from both NB and PC12. DNA-protein interactions seen with untreated HeLa nuclear extracts (lanes 13\u201316) did not apparently vary among PRE variants, but treatment of HeLa with TPA (lanes 17\u201320) resulted in a pattern of interactions that was more similar to those with NB and PC12 extracts. Untreated HeLa (lanes 13\u201316) DNA-protein interactions were unlike those found in the other cell lines surveyed. They had an additional band that migrated more slowly than seen for other cell line nuclear extracts. Interaction was very weak with the wildtype oligomer (lane 13), and it appeared as a doublet. The M1 mutant\u2019s interaction was a single band (lane 14), while M4 and M6 interactions were doublets (lanes 14\u201316). Serum starvation of NIH3T3 (lanes 25\u201328) may have slightly reduced interaction with the M4 mutant (lane 27) but appeared to have no other effect. Treatment of NIH3T3 with IL6 (lanes 29\u201332) increases DNA-protein interaction with the M6 oligomer (lane 32, band I). Of particular interest, treatment of NIH3T3 with TGF\u03b2 (lanes 33\u201336) brought about a dramatic shift in DNA-protein interaction bands for the wildtype PRE and all three mutants. While interaction was visibly weaker than for other NIH3T3 based extracts, it very closely resembled that seen for normal NB (lanes 1\u20134) and PC12 (lanes 2\u20138) extracts. The PRE is well-conserved within the human genome and throughout eutherian mammalsTo explore the possibility that the PRE is well-conserved, we examined genomic sequences identified or putatively identified as proximally upstream of the APP gene of 35 mammal species that were aligned by WebPrank[44] as described herein. Information of the alignment was calculated in bits [45,46] and averaged in a window of 100 nt, which roughly corresponds to the distance between nucleosomes in chromosomal DNA as described herein. Examination of the alignment as a whole revealed that the PRE was well conserved compared to immediately flanking sequences. Adding non-primate sequences to the alignment did not change average information content immediately around the PRE (Figure 8A), but average information content for the alignment dropped off significantly (p <0.05, Bonferroni adjusted for 4 comparisons) when on either side of the PRE. Information inversely expresses homogeneity, since 100% homogeneity at a given base is maximum possible score (2 bits) and equal distribution of all four bases would be 0 bits. thumbnailFigure 8. Multiple sequence alignment of APP upstream regions and test of molecular clock. DNA sequences from 20 mammal species were downloaded from GenBank and aligned with WebPrank as described in the main text. A. Average information content in a window of 100 nt and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for primates, euarchontoglires, boreoeutheria, eutheria, and mammals. B. Alignment was used as input for parsimony/FITCH combined phylogeny estimation as described in the main text. This produced a bifurcating non-ultrametric tree, although some branch lengths = 0. The tree was artificially rooted between marsupials and eutheria, and root-to-tip distances for each species calculated. Root-to-tip distances were compared to mean root-to-tip distance for the entire tree. Individual distances that differed from the mean distance (vertical solid line) \u00b1 the 95% (Bonferroni adjusted for 35 comparisons) confidence interval (vertical dashed lines) were counted as \u201csignificant\u201d. Distances that significantly exceeded the mean indicated by \u201c\u2020\u201d. Differences significantly lower than the mean indicated by \u201c*\u201d. Phylogenetic comparison of the alignment (\u2212326/+202 in the human sequence) led, as expected, to rejection of the molecular clock hypothesis (Figure 8B). DNA changes observed within the, admittedly short, region are unlikely to occur simply through neutral sequence drift. Of particular interest is that most of the primate sequences appeared to have a slower-than-typical rate of change vs. the overall tree while mouse and rat sequences had a faster-than-typical rate of change. Further detailed examination was done of the alignment region immediately surrounding the PRE (Figure 9). Alignment was guided by a tree (Figure 9A) based on current conventional mammal phylogeny [47-49], as suggested by the WebPrank protocol. Sequences were taxonomically weighted as described herein and homologies between the human sequence vs. other primates, euarchontoglires, boreoeutheria, eutheria, and all mammals were calculated for the aligned PRE, as were sequence logos [46] for these groups (Figure 9B\u2013F). The PRE remains fairly stable throughout the eutheria, with no less than 92.3% weighted homology to the human sequence (Table 6). Adding marsupials to the estimation reduces homology to 73.8%. Greater aggregate distance from primates also associates with lower specificity within the PRE (Table 6)\u2014total information content (essentially expressing sequence specificity in terms of bits) drops from 49.04 for primates (including humans) to 39.36 when all mammal sequences are considered (Table 6). Of particular interest, the overlapping SP1/PuF site within the PRE is also well conserved among placental mammals (Figure 9E). However, the site breaks down when marsupial sequences are included (Figure 9F). Marsupials also have a 9\u201310 base insertion within the PRE (Figure 9F\u2013G). thumbnailFigure 9.

Analysis of APP proximal promoter region multiple sequence alignmentDiscussionThe APP gene consists of 18 exons and spans more than 300 kilobases on human chromosome 21 [51]. We hypothesize that unusually high production of A\u03b2 may contribute to AD, and this aberrant A\u03b2 production can be a result of unusually high APP gene expression. The APP gene is a likely locus for sporadic, late-onset AD, the most common form of the disease [2,52,53]. Down syndrome patients invariably develop AD, which may be due to additional gene dose of the APP gene in the Down critical region of chromosome 21. In addition, cases of late-onset AD have increased plasma levels of the forms of A\u03b2 [54] specifically associated with the disease. Tissue and cell-type specific expression of the APP gene may also play a role in APP protein or A\u03b2-related pathogenesis. It is well established that mutations in the APP coding sequence can cause autosomal dominant early onset FAD [55]. Some analyses of the coding sequence [56] and the promoter [57] rejected other APP polymorphisms as predisposing to late onset AD (LOAD). However, there are reports of promoter polymorphisms that increase risk for AD in a non-autosomal fashion [58,59], particularly of two polymorphisms in the APP promoter associated with AD pedigrees [23]. In addition, the following results strongly implicate the role of promoter elements in AD. 1) In a genome screen of 292 sib-pairs with LOAD, Hardy\u2019s group identified 12 loci with lod-scores >1 including a region on chromosomes 21 [60]. 2) Using non-parametric linkage methods, Duke\u2019s group showed that a locus predisposing to LOAD might reside in this region of chromosome 21 [61]. 3) Levels of A\u03b2 correlate to cognitive decline in predementia and dementia [62]. 4) Genetic analysis of a case of DS due to non-disjunction suggested triplication of APP in the pathogenesis of AD in Down syndrome [63]. 5) Younkin\u2019s group analyzed plasma A\u03b2 in 180 first-degree relatives of LOAD patients and in 82 age-matched controls. This analysis showed highly significant increase in plasma A\u03b240/42 in the relatives as compared to controls [64,65]. Serial deletion analysis of the APP promoter has revealed several regulatory elements [14,17]. The APP promoter is regulated by several factors, including but not necessarily limited to nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin-l [20,21]. Copper depletion downregulates APP promoter activity [22]. Various groups have reported other transcriptional elements within the first 100 nt from TSS of the APP gene [19,34,66,67]. This includes regulation of APP promoter expression by two GC-elements [67], the zinc finger protein CTCF [66], and upstream stimulatory factor [19]. We previously reported discovering a 30 nt (\u221276/\u221247) fragment from a deletion series of the APP promoter with different effects depending upon cell line [27]. Our discovery was independently paralleled by other workers, who have noted a fragment of the APP promoter at \u221255/\u221233 by DNAse protection assay. This fragment was predicted to contain AP1 and AP4 binding sites, but both were experimentally excluded [15]. Furthermore, deletion of a \u221254/\u221242 fragment of the APP promoter resulted in reduced expression of reporter fusion clones [68]. In addition, deletion of a \u221277/\u221247 fragment resulted in reduced reporter fusion expression in rat primary embryonic hippocampal neurons [69], which was similar to our own observation of the effect of deleting the PRE in rodent cell lines and opposite what we observed in human cell lines [27]. This other work essentially concluded that USF was the responsible agent for regulation through this APP promoter fragment, although it did propose but not test a putative SP1 binding site. We do not dispute that USF may play an important role in APP proximal protein regulation but investigate the possibility that other factors and cofactors also operate on this sequence. We sought to more fully characterize the activity of the PRE as a component of the 5\u2032-flanking region of the APP gene. Transcription factor binding activity was studied by EMSA with human tissue nuclear extracts, including extracts from human brain, followed by EMSA in four different cell line nuclear extracts under different conditions of stimulation or induction. Binding of specific TFs was tested by competition EMSA and by antibody-supershift EMSA. We also used Southwestern blotting to estimate molecular weights of interaction partners with the PRE and compared these with candidate transcription factors. We have determined that the PRE has tissue specificity, showing greater DNA-protein interaction with brain and lung extracts than with liver or heart extracts. In addition, the PRE has cell line-specific DNA-protein interactions with cell nuclear extracts, differing among U937, HeLa, U373, PC12, NIH3T3 cell lines. These interactions are subject to reduction, elimination, or qualitative change by conditions such as hypoxia, SR, and induction with TPA or IFN-\u03b3), IL6, or TGF\u03b2. Our results suggest that the \u221276/\u221247 region binds to a protein that is upregulated in serum starvation, and downregulated in hypoxia. Because serum starvation contributes to the induction of apoptosis, these results suggest a role of the 30-nt proximal APP promoter element in enhanced apoptotic neuronal cell death. Competition EMSA and antibody-supershift EMSA confirmed predicted interactions between the PRE and AP2, while antibody-supershift EMSA confirmed interaction between the PRE and AP2, PuF, SP1, and USF2. Competition and supershift EMSA appear to contradict each other regarding SP1. Possible biological explanations could include sufficiently high affinity within the PRE for SP1 to overcome competition with the particular commercial probe used. High PRE-SP1 affinity could result in a \u201cnegative\u201d competition result but a positive supershift, since the supershift is meant to detect SP1 when bound to the target DNA. Alternatively, our supershift may be interacting with an SP1-like transcription factor that binds the PRE but has a lower affinity with the consensus SP1 site in the commercial competition oligomer. Southwestern blotting indicated possible interactions between the PRE and AP2, SP1, and USF2, among other TF. It also admitted the possibility of PRE-PuF dimer interaction. We mutated the PRE and highlighted a specific effect of the sequence that included the predicted PuF/SP1 binding site. Our mutant expression evidence tends to agree with our EMSA evidence. Of the mutants characterized, M1 was the most consistent in response across NB and PC12x cells and nuclear extracts. Specifically, semi-quantitative EMSA with M1 probe resulted in significant signal loss at the band position that corresponded closely to the major band of wildtype PRE EMSA in both NB and PC12 nuclear extracts. Likewise, M1 mutant promoter/reporter expression clones resulted in significantly reduced levels of CAT reporter protein in both NB and PC12 cells. The M1 mutant deleted the predicted PuF site and both predicted SP1 sites in the PRE. We note that M2 and M4 each also deleted a single predicted SP1 site, the specific site differing between M2 and M4. EMSA analysis of these two mutants showed that M4 consistently had reduced EMSA interaction at band II, while M2 did not. However, CAT reporter levels were not consistently altered between cell types. There-fore, our mutation analysis confirms our earlier conclusion that the PRE is most likely to function as a site of PuF and SP1 activity. Disruption of the shared PuF/SP1 site in our system resulted in reduced levels of reporter gene product, which appears to contradict part of our proposed model. However primary sequence disruption of the site would influence both PuF (repressive) and SP1 (stimulatory) interaction very strongly. In addition, disruption of the AP2 site also resulted in loss of EMSA signal, suggesting that the PRE may also function under induction as well as constitutively. Currently, two DNA sequence polymorphisms have been reported for the PRE, specifically rs200621906 and rs201592736 [37]. Each is predicted to alter potential TF binding sites within the PRE (Table 7). Of particular note, rs201592736 may interfere with the PuF site. In addition, potentially interesting sites were created, including glucocorticoid/progesterone receptor (GR/PR), NF1-like enkephalin nuclear transcription factor 1 (NKTF1) retinoic acid receptor \u03b3 (RAR\u03b3), and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1),. Glucocorticoid levels are well associated with AD risk [70]. Progesterone supplementation has been linked to more rapid age-related cognitive decline in post-menopausal women [71,72]. Elevated levels of enkephalin contribute to neurological impairment and tau phosphorylation in AD model animals [73]. Upregulation of enkephalin accompanied by upregulation of APP due to an SNP in the PRE may overwhelm natural defenses against neurodegeneration. RARs direct APP processing toward the non-pathogenic \u03b1 pathway [74], and it is conceivable that a feedback mechanism that results in RAR-mediated overproduction of APP in a natural PRE mutant may overwhelm this process. ZEB1 interacts with TGF\u03b2 [75], and TGF\u03b2 is implicated in AD pathogenesis [76,77]. The rs201592736 SNP approximates our M2 mutant, while rs200621906 approximates M4. Combining both polymorphisms approximates the TF deletion effects of M1, which showed significant Bonferroni-adjusted reductions in both EMSA and CAT reporter by meta-analysis. Population frequency of these SNPs has not been published, and it has not been yet determined if they occur as a haplotype or independently. It should be cautioned that, although they have interesting potential TF site changes, functional association with any disease state has also not been determined. Table 7. Natural SNP in the PREThe PRE is strongly conserved in placental mammals, particularly the PuF/SP1 overlapping site. In addition, this conservation occurs in a promoter region that has undergone significant non-neutral (i. e., non-molecular clock) change. In particular, primate and mouse/rat sequences diverge the most from each other in our root-to-tip ana-lysis, but with far less difference when considering the PRE, specifically. We propose that this particular short segment of the APP proximal regulatory region has been specifically maintained, as would be expected of an active promoter segment. We have previously stated that other AD-associated gene promoters, such as for APOE, have important differences between mouse and human [25]. Likewise, we have reported both differences and similarities between human and rat cell line responses to functional promoter deletion clones of the human MAPT promoter [26]. Such overall differences can be put to use in identifying potentially critical regions of similarity, such as the PRE within the APP promoter. Although two SNPs have been reported in the human PRE, it is unlikely, given their obscurity in the literature, that these would be common enough to explain a large proportion of sporadic AD. We propose that the majority of etiologically important PuF vs. SP1 disruption in the PRE would be due to environmental influences on epigenetic markers. The naturally-occurring SNPs could serve as a potential test bed, given their similarity in terms of TF site disruption to some of our synthetic mutants. It is potentially more interesting that the Puf/SP1 site consists primarily of GG and GGG sequences, which are particularly vulnerable to DNA oxidation [78]. While SP1 activity is sensitive to epigenetic DNA modification [79], and PuF operates in repair of DNA damage [80], relative effects of DNA oxidation upon each protein\u2019s activity as a transcription factor have not been established. Likewise, CpG dimers (sites of cytosine methylation) are immediately adjacent to the PuF/SP1 site. Thus, in our system, while disrupting both PuF and SP1 activity by primary sequence mutation may result in overall reduction in reporter levels, environmentally-induced epigenetic alterations to the shared target DNA sequence may favor SP1 stimulation over PuF inhibition. In light of the knowledge that overall PuF activity may be reduced in AD, we do not suggest that epigenetic modification of the PRE would be the sole cause of the disorder. Rather, it would contribute to disruption of normal APP gene expression that would accompany AD. Feedback mechanisms between APP and other misregulated AD associated genes may serve to also reduce PuF activity in concert with direct disruption of APP-PuF interaction. We admit that our current assignment of PuF and SP1 to active status within the PRE has not yet been directly tested. Mammalian PuF is associated with inhibition of invasive metastasis [81-84] and stimulation of normal cell proliferation [85,86]. PuF kinase activity was reduced in human brain in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Down syndrome [87]. Total APP mRNA is elevated in AD brain, specifically KPI(+) isoforms [88]. APP gene expression and SP1 activity are increased in aging primate brains [31]. SP1-DNA interaction and APP expression in mouse brains are increased in a latent fashion by early-life dietary administration of Pb [29]. We suggest an antagonistic role between PuF and SP1, specifically that PuF may serve to downregulate APP gene expression via the PRE in vivo, and increases in effective SP1 activity, due to increased SP1 levels, interference in PuF-DNA interaction at the PRE, or decrease in PuF levels, for example, may overwhelm PuF regulation. The PuF transcription factor/kinase was discovered in the context of inhibiting metastasis [28]. Such inhibition included through interaction with the MYC gene promoter [89,90]. Later, PuF was determined to also function as a kinase independently of its TF activity [91]. PuF TF activity was determined to not only act to inhibit metastasis, but to also operate in non-metastatic cell proliferation [85,86]. In addition to cell proliferative activity, PuF regulates insulin secretion from pancreas islet cells [92], providing another molecular link underlying the recently-proposed metabolic-cognitive syndrome that may unite metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders [93]. We propose that these aspects of PuF may prove important in understanding both AD pathogenesis and the possibility that a role may be played by APP gene products in oncogenesis. Of greater interest is that PuF has already been indirectly linked to AD before our work with the PRE. PuF interacts with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1 (CAMK2N1) [94]. CAMK2N1 is, itself, a potent inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2), which is a mediator of learning and memory [95]. CAMK2 is currently a target of several anti-AD drugs under investigation [96]. Of particular note is that the PRE exists within a DNAse I hypersensitive region [97], and PuF activity is modulated by the presence or absence of a DNAse I hypersensitive region [87]. Likewise, among its amazing variety of functions [98,99], the APP protein is a ferroxidase and activates ferroportin to export iron from neurons [100]. Iron chelation reduces APP protein levels through the APP mRNA 5\u2019-UTR [101], and this is reversed by iron supplementation. Conversely, overexpression of APP results in reduced iron content and increased oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma cells [102]. Although it has also been shown that abnormally high levels of iron accumulate in specific brain regions in AD, particularly within and around amyloid plaques [103], this is not paradoxical, since plaque-associated iron would be extracellular and could be in part due to overactivity of APP in iron transport. In addition, faulty iron metabolism has been strongly linked to cancer and neoplasia, specifically through ferroportin activity [104], and increased serum iron is associated with greater risk for oxidative damage to DNA [105]. Of particular interest for a possible oncology/APP association is that expression of the APP gene in response to iron chelators distinctly differed between neoplastic and normal cell lines [106]. In cancer patients, increased APP gene expression was more common in tumor tissue of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients than in non-cancerous matched tissue samples. More importantly, in those patients who had elevated APP expression, survival at 24 months was 48% vs. 82% for patients with non-elevated APP expression [107]. This suggests that PuF may exert anti-metastatic properties by, in part, altering levels of APP expression, reducing overall results of APP protein\u2019s ferroxidase activity and modulating cancer risk. Basal activity of the APP promoter is greatest in neural origin cell lines, and several promoter elements close to the PRE are important for this activity [108]. For example, the APP promoter contains binding sites for important TFs, such as purine-rich element binding protein-\u03b1 (PUR\u03b1) [109] and early growth response 1 (EGR1) [110]. Notably, there is a high expression of PUR\u03b1 and EGR1 in neurons during brain development and in the adult brain, and negative regulation of APP gene expression by PUR\u03b1 [109]. ConclusionsInterference with TF binding to the PRE in the context of the complete APP promoter could serve to deregulate APP production. Deletion of the PRE from a complete series of APP promoter clones resulted in a 3 to 4 fold gain of promoter activity in NB cells as measured by levels of reporter gene product [27]. While AP2 and USF2 (implicated in our antibody supershifts) are generally stimulatory factors, the normal function of PuF is usually inhibitory of pathogenic cell proliferation, specifically metastasis [83,84]. In addition to inhibiting metastasis, PuF serves to induce normal cell proliferation [83,84]. The APP protein, among its non-pathological functions, is active in the \u201cneuronal pruning\u201d stage of brain development, wherein neurons in the early brain are selectively removed after rapid proliferation [111]. In addition to neurogenesis, PuF homologues regulate early morphological development [112]. Thus, as PuF serves to stimulate non-pathogenic cell proliferation, and APP can act to reduce cell proliferation, it is reasonable to propose the possibility that PuF acts to downregulate APP expression under normal circumstances, and interference in PuF regulation through the PRE could serve to deregulate APP gene expression, potentially contributing to AD pathogenesis (Figure 10). A\u03b2 is a minority product of APP processing [113]. Therefore, increase in APP levels could raise A\u03b2 above a risk threshold for AD. A theoretical union of oncogenic and neurodegenerative models has been proposed in the latent early-life associated regulation (LEARn) model of idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders [38,39], expands and extends the \u201cn-hit\u201d model of pathogenesis commonly accepted in oncology to \u201csporadic\u201d neurodegenerative disorders. Given that the predicted PuF site may be structurally vulnerable to GG oxidation, and thus subject to the LEARn model, we conclude that our work suggests connections between processes that lead to cancer etiology and sporadic neurobiological disorders, both conceptually (LEARn vs. n-hit) and mechanistically (PuF regulation of APP vs. PuF regulation of metastasis). thumbnailFigure 10. Model of Antagonistic PuF vs. SP1 regulation of the APP gene and disruption in AD. A. Non-pathogenic APP expression, levels regulated by PuF. In normal brain, PuF would compete with SP1 at the PRE and result in normal levels of APP mRNA and protein. A\u03b2 would be restricted to non-pathogenic concentrations. B. Pathogenic APP expression resulting from disruption of PuF regulation of the PRE. Disruption of the PRE, such as through environmentally induced DNA oxidation at GG dimers, \u201c*\u201d, may reduce affinity of the PRE for PuF more severely than for SP1. Effective SP1 activity then serves to upregulate APP expression levels beyond a pathogenic threshold. MethodsReagents and enzymesUnless specifically noted otherwise, reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA) or Roche Life Science (Indianapolis, IN). Cell culturePC12 and NB cell lines were obtained from ATCC and cultured as described previously [114]. The plates were incubated in 5% CO2 in a 37\u00b0C incubator. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen/Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). PRE fragments and oligomersThe rhesus monkey APP promoter clone p\u03b2XbB [17] (Figure 11) was digested with restriction enzymes PvuII and XhoI and run on a 10% TAE-polyacrylamide gel. The cell type specific 30 nt (\u221276/\u221247) PRE [27] was purified and end-labeled with \u03b332P-ATP (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). In addition, oligomers corresponding to this sequence and its reverse complement were synthesized (Invitrogen) and similarly radiolabeled. The oligomer pair differs from the plasmid fragment in that it does not have a \u201cTCGA\u201d 5\u2032 overhang. This overhang was filled for wildtype and mutant (see \u201cSemiquantitative EMSA of mutant PRE oligomers\u2026\u201d, herein) synthetic double-stranded oligomers. thumbnailFigure 11. Clone p\u03b2XbB. A deletion series of 6kb of the APP promoter and 5\u2032-UTR was previously constructed [17]. Within this series, an XbaI/BamHI 408bp fragment of the APP proximal promoter and 5\u2032-UTR was inserted in the expression vector pBLCAT3 (Promega). This fragment contained the PRE. The clone was used as the base template for all mutagenesis described herein. Analysis of potential transcription factor binding sites on the PREThe TESS [40] and MatInspector [41] utilities were used to probe the TransFac database with the PRE sequence. EMSA of PRE fragments in human tissue nuclear extractsCell nuclei extracts from human brain, heart, liver, and lungs were prepared as previously described [115,116]. The assay was carried out with 40 pg of PRE from digestion of p\u03b2XbB (about 10,000 cpm) and 10 to 20 \u03bcg of nuclear extracts. Radioactive probe was incubated with human brain, heart, liver, or lung nuclear extracts in 24\u03bcl of EMSA-binding buffer (Active Motif, Carlsbad CA) at 6\u00b0\u20138\u00b0C for 40 minutes. The samples were mixed with loading dye and the products of the reaction were separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in 1 x TGE (50 mM Tris, 384 mM glycine, and 2 mM EDTA). The gel was dried and exposed to X-ray film for autoradiography. Free oligonucleotides ran at the bottom of the gel. Protein-DNA complexes were detected as mobility-retarded bands. EMSA in nuclear extracts from normal and variously stimulated PC12 and human U937 cells Nuclear extracts were obtained commercially (ActiveMotif). PRE oligomer pairs were annealed and radiolabeled as described herein. Radioactive oligomer pairs were incubated with nuclear extracts from PC12, hypoxic PC12, U937, and U937 stimulated with either IFN-\u03b3, TPA, or IFN-\u03b3 + TPA. In addition, one sample was incubated with U937 nuclear extracts and 200x molar excess of unlabeled PRE oligomer pairs. Reaction mixtures were analyzed on nondenaturing PAGE and the gel used for autoradiography. Competition EMSA in nuclear extracts from NB and HeLa cellsCell nuclear extracts from NB and either HeLa cultures or HeLa treated with TPA were obtained commercially (Active Motif). Oligomer pairs for the PRE were annealed and radiolabeled as described herein. Nuclear extracts and oligomer pairs were incubated as described herein, except that some individual samples were incubated with 200x molar excess of unlabeled oligomer pairs. NB extracts were either uncompeted or competed against unlabeled PRE or commercially-obtained oligomer pairs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) known to bind AP1, AP2, SP1, or USF1. EMSA in unstimulated HeLa extracts was not subject to competition. Extracts from TPA-stimulated HeLa were either uncompeted or competed against unlabeled PRE or commercially-obtained oligomers known\n\t\t\t", "question_id": "6", "question_str": "What is the gene symbol for apolipoprotein E?", "answer_options": {"answer_id": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"], "answer_str": ["APP", "AD", "protein", "GATA1", "APOE"]}, "correct_answer_id": "5", "correct_answer_str": "APOE"}, {"topic_id": "1", "topic_name": "Alzheimer_Task", "test_id": "4", "document_id": "4", "document_str": "\nBMC Genomics | Full text | PuF, an antimetastatic and developmental signaling protein, interacts with the Alzheimer's amyloid-beta precursor protein via a tissue-specific proximal regulatory element (PRE)Top Abstract Background Results Discussion Conclusions Methods Abbreviations Competing interests Authors\u2019 contributions Acknowledgements References \ufffc\ufffc BMC GenomicsVolume 14Viewing optionsAbstract Full text PDF (1.7MB) Associated materialPubMed record About this articleReaders' comments Related literatureCited byGoogle blog searchOther articles by authorson Google Scholar Lahiri DK Maloney B Rogers JT Ge YW on PubMed Lahiri DK Maloney B Rogers JT Ge YW Related articles/pageson Googleon Google Scholaron PubMedToolsDownload references Download XMLEmail to a friend Order reprintsPost a comment Share this articleTweet More options...

Formula display:\ufffcAbstractBackgroundAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is intimately tied to amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide. Extraneuronal brain plaques consisting primarily of A\u03b2 aggregates are a hallmark of AD. Intraneuronal A\u03b2 subunits are strongly implicated in disease progression. Protein sequence mutations of the A\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) account for a small proportion of AD cases, suggesting that regulation of the associated gene (APP) may play a more important role in AD etiology. The APP promoter possesses a novel 30 nucleotide sequence, or \u201cproximal regulatory element\u201d (PRE), at \u221276/\u221247, from the +1 transcription start site that confers cell type specificity. This PRE contains sequences that make it vulnerable to epigenetic modification and may present a viable target for drug studies. We examined PRE-nuclear protein interaction by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and PRE mutant EMSA. This was followed by functional studies of PRE mutant/reporter gene fusion clones. ResultsEMSA probed with the PRE showed DNA-protein interaction in multiple nuclear extracts and in human brain tissue nuclear extract in a tissue-type specific manner. We identified transcription factors that are likely to bind the PRE, using competition gel shift and gel supershift: Activator protein 2 (AP2), nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase/metastatic inhibitory protein (PuF), and specificity protein 1 (SP1). These sites crossed a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). EMSA with PRE mutants and promoter/reporter clone transfection analysis further implicated PuF in cells and extracts. Functional assays of mutant/reporter clone transfections were evaluated by ELISA of reporter protein levels. EMSA and ELISA results correlated by meta-analysis. ConclusionsWe propose that PuF may regulate the APP gene promoter and that AD risk may be increased by interference with PuF regulation at the PRE. PuF is targeted by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1, which also interacts with the integrins. These proteins are connected to vital cellular and neurological functions. In addition, the transcription factor PuF is a known inhibitor of metastasis and regulates cell growth during development. Given that APP is a known cell adhesion protein and ferroxidase, this suggests biochemical links among cell signaling, the cell cycle, iron metabolism in cancer, and AD in the context of overall aging. Keywords: Amyloid precursor protein; Alzheimer\u2019s disease; Cancer; Gene regulation; Gene transcription; Iron; Latency; nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase; Oncogenesis; PuF; SP1; Specificity protein 1; Transcription factorBackgroundA diagnostic feature of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is aggregation of toxic amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) into extracellular plaques, suspected of causing or contributing to disease progression [1,2]. In addition, intracellular A\u03b2 has been implicated as having a pathological role in AD and Down syndrome [3], and A\u03b2 may function as a transcription factor (TF) [4,5]. A\u03b2 is cleaved from a larger precursor protein (APP) by a process involving two secretase enzymes, \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase [2]. Hyperphosphorylated \u03c4 protein and \u03b1-synuclein also have a likely role in AD etiology [6-8], and apolipoprotein E (APOE) is linked to a large proportion of cases of AD both by genetic [9,10] and cholesterol-related functional studies [11]. We hypothesize that unusually high production of A\u03b2 significantly contributes to AD, and this aberrant A\u03b2 production can result from unusually high APP gene (APP) expression, particularly in a tissue and cell-type specific manner. Several groups have studied the 5\u2032-flanking region of the APP gene, including its promoter [12-16]. Serial deletion analysis has shown that the APP promoter [14,17] and 5\u2032-UTR [18] contain several regulatory elements that are likely to modulate transcriptional activity. In addition to proximal regulatory regions, two upstream sequences have been identified that regulate the gene\u2019s expression [14], including one that has been shown to generally stimulate APP production [19]. The APP promoter is regulated by a variety of factors. It can be stimulated by nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin-l [20,21], and copper depletion downregulates its activity [22]. A link between APP gene regulation and pathologies such as AD has been shown, for example, by characterization of two APP promoter polymorphisms associated with the pathogenesis of some forms of AD [23]. The more upstream of these two polymorphic sites may function as a target site for A\u03b2 acting as a transcription factor [4,5]. Our group has examined regulatory regions of important AD-associated genes, including APOE[24,25] and microtubule-associated protein \u03c4 (MAPT) [26]. We have also previously characterized a deletion series of the APP promoter in eight different cell lines from five different tissue types in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter construct [27]. We discovered that a novel 30 nucleotide (nt) sequence of \u221276 to \u221247 from the +1 transcription start site (TSS) had differential effect depending upon cell line. In human kidney epithelial cells, deletion of this element resulted in 50-fold reduction of CAT reporter gene activity. In human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma (NB) cells, deletion resulted in a 3 to 4-fold gain of reporter gene activity, the greatest NB cell expression for all clones of the deletion series. We thus termed this region the \u201cproximal regulatory element\u201d (PRE) of the APP gene. We examined the nature of DNA-protein interaction with this DNA fragment by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA or gel shift). Notably, use of the PRE as a probe in EMSA showed evidence of DNA-protein interaction with this sequence in multiple cell line nuclear extracts and in mouse brain tissue nuclear extract [27]. However, the specific nature of nuclear proteins that interact with the PRE in different cell types was not determined at that time. We continue our work on the PRE by exploring specific DNA-protein interactions in EMSA, competition EMSA, and antibody-supershift EMSA. Functional effects were measured by creation of a library of mutant PRE sequences within a previously constructed [17]APP-CAT fusion clone. While we had previously shown that the PRE interacts with nuclear proteins in a tissue-type specific manner, we herein identified TFs that were likely bind to the PRE, specifically activator protein 2 (AP2), nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase/metastatic inhibitory protein (PuF), and specificity protein 1 (SP1). We also characterized quantitative and qualitative effects of mutating the PRE vs. DNA-protein interaction in EMSA vs. both NB and rat neuronal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and cell nuclear extracts. Functional assays of PRE mutation effects were performed by transiently transfecting the mutant-CAT clones into human neuroblastoma and rat neuronal pheochromocytoma cell cultures. We discovered specific, significant mutation-dependent function differences. We compared the EMSA results to effects of the same mutations in functional mutant-CAT clone transfection assays. Altering the PRE\u2019s ability to bind TF corresponded to functional changes in promoter activity in a cell line-specific manner. We determined that PuF and SP1 are candidates for regulation of the APP gene through the PRE. PuF\u2019s better-known function is as an inhibitor of metastasis [28]. SP1 activity in APP regulation has already been well demonstrated [29-33]. SP1 sites have been located in both the promoter [13,32,34] and 5\u2032-UTR portions of the APP 5\u2032-flanking region [35,36]. Our data led us to propose that SP1 and PuF act antagonistically through the PRE, with SP1 stimulating and PuF repressing APP transcription. These two TF sites can be subject to natural variation in the human genome, as they cross a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [37]. The PRE sequence contains sites for DNA methylation and oxidation, suggesting the site may be vulnerable to environmentally-mediated epigenetic modification. Should such interference with PuF regulation of APP increase risk of AD, it would be another similarity between etiology of sporadic/idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders and oncogenesis, extending our previous work in developing the latent early-life associated regulation (LEARn) model [38,39] of idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders. ResultsPutative transcription factor sites within the PREThe PRE with an additional 10nt flanking sequence at either end was used with TESS [40] and MatInspector [41] to probe the TransFac database [42]. Restricting predicted sites to mammal TF matrices and eliminating redundant sites resulted in predicted affinities with several transcription factors (Table 1), including AP2, GATA binding proteins 1 (GATA1) and 2 (GATA2), two GC boxes, paired box gene 4-a (Pax4a), PuF, Epstein-Barr virus transcription factor R (R), SP1, and transcription elongation regulator 1 (mammal homologue to zeste, TCERG1). Truncated upstream stimulatory factor (USF)1 and USF2 sites were also found at the 3\u2032-end of the PRE. The GC box is associated with the binding of several transcription factors, including SP1, basic transcription element binding protein (BTEB)1, BTEB2, and msh homeobox 1 (Msx1). Table 1. Predicted TF sites in the PREDNA-protein interaction of the PRE by EMSA varies among tissue types and cell line conditions To investigate cell type specificity of PRE-protein interactions, we used the PRE fragment in EMSA with nuclear extracts from PC12 and human cervical epithelial (HeLa), SK-N-BE neuroblastoma (NB), and histiocytic lymphoma (U937) cells (Figure 1A\u2013C) and with nuclear extracts from human tissues (Figure 1D). PC12 extracts (Figure 1A) were obtained from both normal and hypoxic cells (lanes 1\u20132). U937 extracts (Figure 1A) included nuclei from untreated cells and from cells treated with interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or TPA + IFN-\u03b3 (lanes 3\u20137). In addition, to test specificity of PRE binding with untreated U937 extracts, we also competed the PRE/U937 EMSA against 200x molar excess unlabeled PRE fragment (lane 5). Nuclear extract EMSA showed definite interaction between the PRE and both PC12 and U937 extracts. This interaction was competed away with excess PRE in U937 extracts. DNA-protein interactions could be altered by specific treatment of cells from which extracts were taken. Hypoxia greatly reduced the observed interaction in PC12 extracts (lane 2). Treatment with the cytokine IFN-\u03b3 may have slightly increased interaction in U937 extracts (lane 4), but TPA treatment seems to have produced a stronger result (lane 6). Combined TPA+IFN-\u03b3 treatment (lane 7) reduced DNA-protein interaction levels, suggesting that more than one pathway may be involved in interaction with the PRE and that these interactions may compete with each other. thumbnailFigure 1. EMSA in stimulated and unstimulated cell culture nuclear extracts and vs. various transcription factor binding oligomers. A. Radiolabeled PRE was incubated with PC12 or U937 nuclear extracts. PC12 extracts were either normal (lane 1) or from cells subject to hypoxia (lane 2). U937 extracts were either normal (lanes 3, 6) or from INF-\u03b3 induced (lane 4), TPA-induced (lane 6), or TPA + INF-\u03b3 induced cells (lane 7). In addition, one sample of normal U937 extract was incubated both with labeled and 200x molar excess of unlabeled PRE (lane 5). Arrows indicate major DNA-protein interactions. B, C. The PRE fragment from plasmid p\u03b2XbB was radiolabeled and incubated in NB or HeLa cell nuclear extracts with or without 200x molar excess competition against oligomers known to bind specific transcription factors. DNA-protein interactions are indicated with arrows. B. NB cell nuclear extracts. No competition (lane 1), competition vs. unlabeled PRE (lane 2), competition vs. unlabeled oligomers that bind AP1 (lane 3), AP2 (lane 4), SP1 (lane 5), or USF1 (lane 6). C. HeLa (lane 1) or TPA-stimulated HeLa (lanes 2\u20136) nuclear extracts. Reactions were subjected to no competition (lanes 1\u20132) competition vs. 200x molar excess of unlabeled PRE fragment (lane 3), AP1-binding oligomer (lane 4), AP2-binding oligomer, or USF-binding oligomer (lane 5). D. EMSA of the PRE in four human tissue nuclear extracts. The DNA fragment corresponding to the PRE (\u221276/-47) was purified from plasmid p\u03b2XbB, radiolabeled, and incubated in nuclear extracts from human lung (lane 1), liver (lane 2), heart (lane 3), or brain (lane 4). DNA-protein interaction band is indicated by arrow. Unbound probe ran at the bottom of the gel (not shown). To narrow down candidate transcription factors predicted by TESS we conducted EMSA with 200x molar excess of unlabeled oligomer pairs known to bind the transcription factors activator protein 1 (AP1), AP2, and SP1, respectively. In addition, to demonstrate that the truncated USF1 site at the 3\u2032-end of the PRE is not active, we competed against an unlabeled commercial oligomer pair known to bind USF1 (Figure 1B, C). Two assays were carried out under the same conditions, one each with nuclear extracts from NB (Figure 1B) and HeLa (Figure 1C) cells, respectively. In NB extracts, competition against AP1, SP1, and USF1 binding oligomer pairs (lanes 3, 5, 6) showed no difference with the uncompeted lane sample (lane 1). Competition with unlabeled PRE eliminated DNA-protein interactions (lane 2), while competition with AP2-binding oligomer pair reduced but did not eliminate interaction, suggesting that PRE interaction in neuronal cells may operate through more than one pathway or at least with more than one potential transcription factor. Competition EMSA in HeLa extracts was in TPA-treated extracts (Figure 1C, lanes 2\u20136). Comparing untreated HeLa nuclear extracts with TPA-treated extracts revealed that TPA induction changed DNA-protein interactions with the PRE (Figure 1C, lanes 1\u20132). Competition with the PRE nearly eliminated DNA-protein interaction (lane 3). Competition with oligomer pairs that bind AP1 (lane 4) and AP2 (lane 5) partially reduced DNA-protein interaction. Competition with the USFl-binding oligomer pairs showed little difference to uncompeted TPA-treated extracts (lane 6). These results indicate that the PRE may interact with AP2, at the very least, but AP2 is neither the sole interaction partner for the PRE in neuronal cells nor under phorbol ester induction. To directly explore tissue specificity of PRE interaction with factors present specifically in whole-tissue human organs in addition to cell cultures, we also carried out EMSA of the PRE fragment in human brain, heart, liver, and lung nuclear extracts. Two of the four extracts tested formed DNA-protein complexes with the PRE, specifically lung and brain extracts (Figure 1D lanes 1, 4). This suggests that the PRE is likely to have tissue-specific function in vivo, in addition to what may be suggested by cell culture results, and that the brain is at least one center of such affinity. DNA-protein interactions in NB nuclear extracts is TF specific by gel supershift EMSAFor further information on specific nuclear factors that would interact with the PRE, we performed supershift EMSA with radiolabeled PRE oligomer pairs in NB nuclear extracts (Figure 2). Extracts were either untreated or co-incubated with antibodies against nuclear factors AP1, AP2, PuF, SP1, or combined AP2 + PuF. As negative controls, we incubated NB extracts with labeled PRE oligomer pairs and antibodies against USF1 or USF2. thumbnailFigure 2. Antibody supershift EMSA of PRE in NB nuclear extracts. Radiolabeled PRE oligomer pairs were incubated with NB cell nuclear extracts (lane 1) and with extracts in the presence of antibodies against transcription factors AP1 (lane 2), AP2 (lane 3), PuF (lane 4), AP2 + PuF (lane 5), SP1 (lane 6), USF1 (lane 7), or USF2 (lane 8). Arrows indicate seven major bands. Incubation of PRE oligomers with NB extracts was not altered by co-incubation with anti-AP1 (lanes 1\u20132), primarily consisting of a single band. As predicted, anti-AP2 and anti-PuF each altered binding of the PRE with NB extracts (lanes 3\u20134). In addition to reducing the major DNA-protein interaction of un-competed PRE (band III), new DNA-protein interactions (bands V and VI) became visible when anti-AP2 was co-incubated. Co-incubation with anti-PuF produced a similar pattern to anti-AP2, with an additional band (IV). Of particular interest is that co-incubation with both antibodies reduced DNA-protein interaction more than did incubation with either antibody alone, and completely eliminated the interaction at band III (lane 5). Co-incubation with anti-SP1 produced a more classic \u201cshift\u201d response (lane 6, band I). Co-incubation with anti-USF1 (lane 7) did not result in any changes. Co-incubation with anti-USF2, on the other hand, produced a response similar to that found with anti-AP2 or anti-PuF. In addition, band II appears, but this band may also be already present but masked by the breadth of band III in untreated reactions. Close examination of lane I indicates that the interaction at band VI may also be present in untreated reactions. Bands IV and V, on the other hand, do not appear when the PRE is incubated with NB extracts in the absence of antibody or in the presence of AP1, SP1, or USF1 antibodies. These results indicate that AP2, PuF, SP1, and USF2 are all potential candidates for interaction with the PRE. Southwestern blotting with the PRE shows different DNA-protein interactions among different cell lines and conditions To ascertain sizes of proteins that participate in some of the observed interactions with the PRE, we performed southwestern blotting with nuclear extracts from NB, PC12, HeLa and TPA-treated HeLa cells (Figure 3). Probing with radiolabeled PRE oligomer pairs revealed that DNA-protein interactions varied among extracts and were subject to induction. NB nuclear extract (lane 1) had major interactions at approximately 92, 33, 32, and 23 kDa (the last an extrapolation outside the range of the size standard). In addition, faint bands appeared at approximately 64, 51, and 39 kDa. The PC12 nuclear extract (lane 2) also had a 33 kDa/32 kDa doublet but lacked a 92 kDa interaction. Instead, an interaction at approximately 60 kDa appears. thumbnailFigure 3. Southwestern blot of PRE vs. cell line nuclear extracts. Nuclear extracts from cell lines NB (lane 1), PC12 (lane 2), HeLa (lane 3), and HeLa treated with TPA (lane 4) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane was probed with radiolabeled PRE oligomers. Blot photographs were size-equalized by use of the same lot of protein standards. Major bands are indicated with solid arrows. Minor bands are indicated with dotted-line arrows. PC12 also had weaker interactions at 92, 39, and 23 kDa. HeLa nuclear extract (lane 3) shared interactions at approximately 92 and between 33 and 32 kDa, with fainter bands at 64, 60, 51, 39, and 23 kDa. Induction of HeLa with TPA (lane 4) resolved the 33/32 kDa band into a doublet and reduced the strength of weaker interactions. Comparison of the observed southwestern bands with molecular weights of predicted transcription factors suggests the possibility that several of the predicted candidate transcription factors may bind to the PRE (Table 2). Table 2. Putative TF sites from southwestern blot based on estimated kDa of bandsThese comparisons were based on a \u00b110% adjustment to the calculated southwestern band kDa. Of the potential DNA-TF interactions, several appear for all nuclear extracts. These are AP2, Msx1, and USF1. A few are unique to human neuroblastoma nuclear extracts, specifically Pax4a, USF2, and BTEB2. There is no signal that can be assigned to PuF subunits, which would be around 17kDa in weight. This may be an artifact of the specific gel\u2019s polyacrylamide percentage. However, the band VI/VII doublet could correspond to PuF dimers. In general, the southwestern does not exclude conclusions of our EMSA-based assays. Mutating the PRE alters DNA-protein interactionTo more specifically determine those sequences within the PRE that participate in gene regulation, we had synthesized a series of oligomer pairs that deleted one or more of the transcription factor sites we predicted to be in the PRE. These mutant oligomers were used for EMSA (Figure 4A, B) in both NB (lanes 1\u20138) and PC12 (lanes 9\u201316) cell nuclear extracts. Mutations resulted in both quantitative and qualitative alterations in DNA-protein interaction as determined by EMSA. Densitometry scans revealed that, at least for some mutants, such as M6, two partially overlapping bands appeared (Figure 4A, lane 7), and the wildtype oligomer pair has an extended trailing end to its peak, suggesting that wildtype binding is to more than one interaction partner. Semi-quantitative analysis, therefore, was done for all samples on each individual peak (division between peaks shown by dashed line in Figure 4A-C). thumbnailFigure 4. EMSA of wildtype and mutant PRE oligomers and semiquantitative analysis of EMSA. Wildtype and mutant PRE oligomers (M1-M7) were incubated with A. NB and B. PC12 nuclear extracts were analyzed on non-denaturing PAGE. Samples were analyzed in triplicate; figure presents a representative gel for each. Bands \u201cI\u201d and \u201cII\u201d as described in the main text are indicated. Dashed line indicates division made between band I and band II for densitometry purposes. C. Cross section of EMSA lanes. ImageJ software was used to evaluate densitometry of scanned films from EMSA of NB and PC12 nuclear extracts with various PRE variant oligomer pairs.

Densitometry readings for EMSA films were normalized to standard deviations and average readings for \u201cwildtype\u201d signal within each film as described in the main text. Normalized readings were compared to the wildtype reading by Dunnett\u2019s multiple t. Means significantly different at p > 0.05 indicated by \u201c*\u201d. D. Band I, NB extract. E. Band I, PC12 extract. F. Band II, NB extract. G. Band II, PC12 extract. Starkly visible qualitative differences were restricted to mutants M1, M4 and M6. The M1 mutants\u2019 predicted binding sites had lower affinity for AP2, GATA1, PuF, one of the two predicted SP1 transcription factor sites, and a downstream GC box. The M4 mutant is predicted to lose the shared GATA1/GATA2 site and the downstream SP1 site, The M6 mutant loses a predicted binding site for zeste homolog/TCERG1. In the case of the first two mutants, the major DNA-protein interaction product\u2019s migration was reduced compared to the wildtype oligomer pair\u2019s primary interaction product (Figure 4C). Analysis of relative migration rates for the wildtype oligomer pair showed that migration of the DNA-protein interaction products for M1 (lanes 2, 10) and M4 (lanes 5, 13) were significantly (p<0.05) reduced from the relative migration rate of wildtype oligomers (lanes 1, 9). The M6 mutation (lanes 7, 15) produced two major DNA-protein interactions in EMSA. The peak of the slower-running interaction was significantly (p<0.05) retarded in PC12 but not NB cells. Samples were processed and analyzed in triplicate and films densitometrically scanned. Densitometry results were normalized by subtracting the mean peak value for a single film and dividing by standard deviation for the film. For data presentation purposes, this was adjusted by subtracting the standardized value of \u201cwildtype\u201d, which sets \u201cwildtype\u201d value to 0 (Figure 4D\u2013G, Tables 3, 4). Adjusted data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s two-tailed t. Hedges g standard pairwise effect sizes [43], using mean square error for pooled standard deviation, were calculated for each variant vs. wildtype PRE (Tables 3, 4). Table 3. Adjusted/normalized ELISA and EMSA signals in NB cells and extractsTable 4. Adjusted/normalized ELISA and EMSA signals in PC12 cells and extractsAnalysis revealed differences between mutation effects on each band\u2019s signal strengths. Specifically, for band I (the slower-migrating band), the M1 mutant had significantly higher adjusted signal than wildtype in NB (Figure 4D, Table 3) nuclear extract. M2 in NB and PC12 extracts had significantly lower adjusted signal than did wildtype (Figure 4E, Table 4). For the dominant wildtype PRE EMSA band (band II), M3 and M7 had significantly higher signal than wildtype in NB (Figure 4F, Table 3) and PC12 (Figure 4G, Table 4) nuclear extracts, while M1 and M4 had significantly reduced signal in NB and PC12 extracts. Mutating the PRE in a reporter gene system produces specific functional differencesTo reveal connections between DNA-protein interactions and expression in mutations of the PRE, we constructed seven plasmids that mutated the PRE sequence identically to the mutant PRE oligomers. These cons-tructs were all based on p\u03b2XbB [17], which contains a promoterless CAT gene sequence under the control of an XbaI/BamHI fragment of the rhesus monkey APP gene promoter and 5\u2032-UTR, specifically \u2212309/+104, with +1 being the transcription start site (Figure 5A). Clones were transfected into PC12 and NB cell cultures as described herein. thumbnailFigure 5. ELISA of PRE variant CAT reporter clones in NB and PC12 cells. Functional differences of PRE mutant clones (M1-M7) from wildtype were assayed in NB and PC12 cells. A. p\u03b2XbB were constructed and transfected into NB or PC12 cell cultures as described in the main text. Cultures were harvested and analyzed by CAT ELISA. ELISA signals were normalized to \u201cwildtype\u201d values and subject to Dunnett\u2019s multiple t. Means significantly different at p > 0.05 indicated by \u201c*\u201d. B. ELISA of samples from NB cell cultures. C. ELISA of samples from PC12 cell cultures. Data presented is back-transformed from statistical analysis. Asymmetrical error bars and Dunnett\u2019s t limits are due to Box-Cox transformation, when used. ELISA results of the functional assay were adjusted for \u03b2-gal levels and made relative to wildtype = 1. Adjusted results were compared to wildtype by Dunnett\u2019s t, and Hedges g was calculated for each pairwise comparison (Tables 3, 4). Functional mutation effects in NB cells (Figure 5B, Table 3) were distinct from PC12 (Figure 5C, Table 4). In NB cells three mutants (M1, M5, and M6) had reduced reporter expression compared to wildtype, and mutant M3, had greater adjusted reporter expression than wildtype. In PC12 cells, mutants M1, M4, M5, and M6 had significantly lower CAT protein levels than wildtype. Mutating predicted locations of putative transcription factor sites in the PRE significantly alters reporter gene expression. These results were consistent between cell lines for the M1 and M5 mutants. Semiquantitative EMSA and ELISA specifically correlate by PRE mutantsWe compared EMSA and ELISA results by meta-analysis of pairwise Hedges g for ELISA and EMSA results vs. wildtype (Figure 6). For both NB and PC12 cells/ nuclear extracts, much weaker correlations were found between EMSA band I and ELISA signal (Figure 6A, B). Stronger correlations existed between EMSA band II and ELISA signal in both cell lines (Table 5; Figure 6C, D). Significance was estimated as chance that r \u2260 0 by bootstrap (500,000 repetitions). thumbnailFigure 6. EMSA vs. ELISA standardized effect sizes for PRE variants in NB and PC12 nuclear extracts and cultures. EMSA and ELISA results were used to generate Hedges pairwise g of comparisons of each mutant to wildtype PRE. Data was plotted with EMSA g on X axis and ELISA g on Y axis. Samples where both EMSA and ELISA signals were significantly different from wildtype at Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05 are indicated with corresponding mutant names. Correlations were bootstrapped (repeats = 100000), and frequency distributions of correlation coefficients are presented as insets. A. EMSA Band I vs. ELISA in NB extract/cells. B. EMSA Band I vs. ELISA in PC12 extract/cells. C. EMSA Band II vs. ELISA in NB extract/cells. D. EMSA Band II vs. ELISA in PC12 extract/cells. Table 5. Meta-analysis of PRE and mutant EMSA vs. ELISAThe percent overlap between the two bootstrap distributions within a single cell line was also calculated. The difference between correlations of EMSA I to ELISA vs. EMSA II to ELISA was more distinct in PC12 cells, with a 16% overlap between the two bootstrap distributions. In NB cells, the two bootstrap distributions overlapped by 34%. While there may be some indication of a direct relationship between EMSA band II signal and reporter ELISA results, we suggest caution in interpreting correlation meta-analysis. In addition to modest, at best, estimations of significance, EMSA bands I and II did not distinctly resolve on autoradiographs in many variants we studied, including wildtype (Figure 4). In addition, cell cultures used for ELISA and nuclear extracts used for EMSA did not come from the same specific cultures. Even with bootstrap estimation, they essentially represent correlations of averaged results from each assay. Nevertheless, we accept the possibility that some correspondence exists between altering the strength of the major DNA-protein interaction for the wildtype olig-omer pair (band II) and functional effects in reporter fusion assay. Mutating the PRE produces cell line-specific and inducible effects, as measured by EMSA To further investigate possible cell line/type-specific effects of the PRE, three mutants, specifically M1, M4, and M6, plus the wildtype PRE, were used as probes in EMSA with nuclear extracts from NB, PC12, human glioblastoma-astrocytoma (U373), HeLa or mouse embryo fibroblast (NIH3T3) cells. In addition, these oligomers were assayed with EMSA with nuclear extracts from HeLa, or NIH3T3 cells that had been subject to induction conditions, such as TPA treatment, serum starvation or induction with cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL6) or transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) (Figure 7). Three apparent bands, marked N (\u201cnull\u201d/\u201czero\u201d), I, and II, appeared among the various nuclear extracts, although no extract/mutant combination had all three bands. In nuclear extracts from NB cells (Figure 7, lanes 1\u20134), DNA-protein interactions were obtained as reported in 3.1. Wildtype oligomers produced a single strong interaction (lane I, band II). The M1 and M4 oligomer pairs each had an interaction that migrated more slowly than did the wildtype (lanes 2\u20133), while M6 had a mixed interaction, with bands that migrated both at the same rate as produced by wildtype and as by M1 (lane 4) oligomer pairs. The PC12 extracts (lanes 5\u20138) produced a pattern similar to that found with NB extracts, excepting that the DNA-protein interaction with M4 (lane 7) has a stronger \u201cleading\u201d edge to its band while the interaction with M6 has a weaker \u201ctrailing\u201d peak in the band doublet (lane 8). thumbnailFigure 7. EMSA of PRE and selected mutants in NB, PC12, HeLa, NIH3T3, and U373 nuclear extracts. Wildtype oligomers (lanes 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33) and oligomers for the M1 (lanes 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34), M4 (lanes 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35), and M6 (lanes 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36) were labeled with \u03b3\u221232P-ATP, incubated with NB (lanes 1\u20134) PC12 (lanes 5\u20138), U373 (lanes 9\u201312), HeLa (lanes 13\u201316), HeLa + TPA (lanes 17\u201320), NIH3T3 (lanes 21\u201324), NIH3T3 + serum restriction (lanes 25\u201328), NIH3T3 + IL6 (lanes 29\u201332), and NIH3T3 + TGF\u03b2 (lanes 33\u201336) nuclear extracts, and analyzed on nondenaturing PAGE, and gels subject to autoradiography. Interactions observed with U373 extracts (lanes 9\u201312) bore some resemblance to those observed with NB and PC12 nuclear extracts specifically for wildtype (lane 9) and M1 (lane 10). However, the M4 and M6 DNA-protein interactions (lanes 11, 12) were noticeably different from both NB and PC12. DNA-protein interactions seen with untreated HeLa nuclear extracts (lanes 13\u201316) did not apparently vary among PRE variants, but treatment of HeLa with TPA (lanes 17\u201320) resulted in a pattern of interactions that was more similar to those with NB and PC12 extracts. Untreated HeLa (lanes 13\u201316) DNA-protein interactions were unlike those found in the other cell lines surveyed. They had an additional band that migrated more slowly than seen for other cell line nuclear extracts. Interaction was very weak with the wildtype oligomer (lane 13), and it appeared as a doublet. The M1 mutant\u2019s interaction was a single band (lane 14), while M4 and M6 interactions were doublets (lanes 14\u201316). Serum starvation of NIH3T3 (lanes 25\u201328) may have slightly reduced interaction with the M4 mutant (lane 27) but appeared to have no other effect. Treatment of NIH3T3 with IL6 (lanes 29\u201332) increases DNA-protein interaction with the M6 oligomer (lane 32, band I). Of particular interest, treatment of NIH3T3 with TGF\u03b2 (lanes 33\u201336) brought about a dramatic shift in DNA-protein interaction bands for the wildtype PRE and all three mutants. While interaction was visibly weaker than for other NIH3T3 based extracts, it very closely resembled that seen for normal NB (lanes 1\u20134) and PC12 (lanes 2\u20138) extracts. The PRE is well-conserved within the human genome and throughout eutherian mammalsTo explore the possibility that the PRE is well-conserved, we examined genomic sequences identified or putatively identified as proximally upstream of the APP gene of 35 mammal species that were aligned by WebPrank[44] as described herein. Information of the alignment was calculated in bits [45,46] and averaged in a window of 100 nt, which roughly corresponds to the distance between nucleosomes in chromosomal DNA as described herein. Examination of the alignment as a whole revealed that the PRE was well conserved compared to immediately flanking sequences. Adding non-primate sequences to the alignment did not change average information content immediately around the PRE (Figure 8A), but average information content for the alignment dropped off significantly (p <0.05, Bonferroni adjusted for 4 comparisons) when on either side of the PRE. Information inversely expresses homogeneity, since 100% homogeneity at a given base is maximum possible score (2 bits) and equal distribution of all four bases would be 0 bits. thumbnailFigure 8. Multiple sequence alignment of APP upstream regions and test of molecular clock. DNA sequences from 20 mammal species were downloaded from GenBank and aligned with WebPrank as described in the main text. A. Average information content in a window of 100 nt and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for primates, euarchontoglires, boreoeutheria, eutheria, and mammals. B. Alignment was used as input for parsimony/FITCH combined phylogeny estimation as described in the main text. This produced a bifurcating non-ultrametric tree, although some branch lengths = 0. The tree was artificially rooted between marsupials and eutheria, and root-to-tip distances for each species calculated. Root-to-tip distances were compared to mean root-to-tip distance for the entire tree. Individual distances that differed from the mean distance (vertical solid line) \u00b1 the 95% (Bonferroni adjusted for 35 comparisons) confidence interval (vertical dashed lines) were counted as \u201csignificant\u201d. Distances that significantly exceeded the mean indicated by \u201c\u2020\u201d. Differences significantly lower than the mean indicated by \u201c*\u201d. Phylogenetic comparison of the alignment (\u2212326/+202 in the human sequence) led, as expected, to rejection of the molecular clock hypothesis (Figure 8B). DNA changes observed within the, admittedly short, region are unlikely to occur simply through neutral sequence drift. Of particular interest is that most of the primate sequences appeared to have a slower-than-typical rate of change vs. the overall tree while mouse and rat sequences had a faster-than-typical rate of change. Further detailed examination was done of the alignment region immediately surrounding the PRE (Figure 9). Alignment was guided by a tree (Figure 9A) based on current conventional mammal phylogeny [47-49], as suggested by the WebPrank protocol. Sequences were taxonomically weighted as described herein and homologies between the human sequence vs. other primates, euarchontoglires, boreoeutheria, eutheria, and all mammals were calculated for the aligned PRE, as were sequence logos [46] for these groups (Figure 9B\u2013F). The PRE remains fairly stable throughout the eutheria, with no less than 92.3% weighted homology to the human sequence (Table 6). Adding marsupials to the estimation reduces homology to 73.8%. Greater aggregate distance from primates also associates with lower specificity within the PRE (Table 6)\u2014total information content (essentially expressing sequence specificity in terms of bits) drops from 49.04 for primates (including humans) to 39.36 when all mammal sequences are considered (Table 6). Of particular interest, the overlapping SP1/PuF site within the PRE is also well conserved among placental mammals (Figure 9E). However, the site breaks down when marsupial sequences are included (Figure 9F). Marsupials also have a 9\u201310 base insertion within the PRE (Figure 9F\u2013G). thumbnailFigure 9.

We hypothesize that unusually high production of A\u03b2 may contribute to AD, and this aberrant A\u03b2 production can be a result of unusually high APP gene expression. The APP gene is a likely locus for sporadic, late-onset AD, the most common form of the disease [2,52,53]. Down syndrome patients invariably develop AD, which may be due to additional gene dose of the APP gene in the Down critical region of chromosome 21. In addition, cases of late-onset AD have increased plasma levels of the forms of A\u03b2 [54] specifically associated with the disease. Tissue and cell-type specific expression of the APP gene may also play a role in APP protein or A\u03b2-related pathogenesis. It is well established that mutations in the APP coding sequence can cause autosomal dominant early onset FAD [55]. Some analyses of the coding sequence [56] and the promoter [57] rejected other APP polymorphisms as predisposing to late onset AD (LOAD). However, there are reports of promoter polymorphisms that increase risk for AD in a non-autosomal fashion [58,59], particularly of two polymorphisms in the APP promoter associated with AD pedigrees [23]. In addition, the following results strongly implicate the role of promoter elements in AD. 1) In a genome screen of 292 sib-pairs with LOAD, Hardy\u2019s group identified 12 loci with lod-scores >1 including a region on chromosomes 21 [60]. 2) Using non-parametric linkage methods, Duke\u2019s group showed that a locus predisposing to LOAD might reside in this region of chromosome 21 [61]. 3) Levels of A\u03b2 correlate to cognitive decline in predementia and dementia [62]. 4) Genetic analysis of a case of DS due to non-disjunction suggested triplication of APP in the pathogenesis of AD in Down syndrome [63]. 5) Younkin\u2019s group analyzed plasma A\u03b2 in 180 first-degree relatives of LOAD patients and in 82 age-matched controls. This analysis showed highly significant increase in plasma A\u03b240/42 in the relatives as compared to controls [64,65]. Serial deletion analysis of the APP promoter has revealed several regulatory elements [14,17]. The APP promoter is regulated by several factors, including but not necessarily limited to nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin-l [20,21]. Copper depletion downregulates APP promoter activity [22]. Various groups have reported other transcriptional elements within the first 100 nt from TSS of the APP gene [19,34,66,67]. This includes regulation of APP promoter expression by two GC-elements [67], the zinc finger protein CTCF [66], and upstream stimulatory factor [19]. We previously reported discovering a 30 nt (\u221276/\u221247) fragment from a deletion series of the APP promoter with different effects depending upon cell line [27]. Our discovery was independently paralleled by other workers, who have noted a fragment of the APP promoter at \u221255/\u221233 by DNAse protection assay. This fragment was predicted to contain AP1 and AP4 binding sites, but both were experimentally excluded [15]. Furthermore, deletion of a \u221254/\u221242 fragment of the APP promoter resulted in reduced expression of reporter fusion clones [68]. In addition, deletion of a \u221277/\u221247 fragment resulted in reduced reporter fusion expression in rat primary embryonic hippocampal neurons [69], which was similar to our own observation of the effect of deleting the PRE in rodent cell lines and opposite what we observed in human cell lines [27]. This other work essentially concluded that USF was the responsible agent for regulation through this APP promoter fragment, although it did propose but not test a putative SP1 binding site. We do not dispute that USF may play an important role in APP proximal protein regulation but investigate the possibility that other factors and cofactors also operate on this sequence. We sought to more fully characterize the activity of the PRE as a component of the 5\u2032-flanking region of the APP gene. Transcription factor binding activity was studied by EMSA with human tissue nuclear extracts, including extracts from human brain, followed by EMSA in four different cell line nuclear extracts under different conditions of stimulation or induction. Binding of specific TFs was tested by competition EMSA and by antibody-supershift EMSA. We also used Southwestern blotting to estimate molecular weights of interaction partners with the PRE and compared these with candidate transcription factors. We have determined that the PRE has tissue specificity, showing greater DNA-protein interaction with brain and lung extracts than with liver or heart extracts. In addition, the PRE has cell line-specific DNA-protein interactions with cell nuclear extracts, differing among U937, HeLa, U373, PC12, NIH3T3 cell lines. These interactions are subject to reduction, elimination, or qualitative change by conditions such as hypoxia, SR, and induction with TPA or IFN-\u03b3), IL6, or TGF\u03b2. Our results suggest that the \u221276/\u221247 region binds to a protein that is upregulated in serum starvation, and downregulated in hypoxia. Because serum starvation contributes to the induction of apoptosis, these results suggest a role of the 30-nt proximal APP promoter element in enhanced apoptotic neuronal cell death. Competition EMSA and antibody-supershift EMSA confirmed predicted interactions between the PRE and AP2, while antibody-supershift EMSA confirmed interaction between the PRE and AP2, PuF, SP1, and USF2. Competition and supershift EMSA appear to contradict each other regarding SP1. Possible biological explanations could include sufficiently high affinity within the PRE for SP1 to overcome competition with the particular commercial probe used. High PRE-SP1 affinity could result in a \u201cnegative\u201d competition result but a positive supershift, since the supershift is meant to detect SP1 when bound to the target DNA. Alternatively, our supershift may be interacting with an SP1-like transcription factor that binds the PRE but has a lower affinity with the consensus SP1 site in the commercial competition oligomer. Southwestern blotting indicated possible interactions between the PRE and AP2, SP1, and USF2, among other TF. It also admitted the possibility of PRE-PuF dimer interaction. We mutated the PRE and highlighted a specific effect of the sequence that included the predicted PuF/SP1 binding site. Our mutant expression evidence tends to agree with our EMSA evidence. Of the mutants characterized, M1 was the most consistent in response across NB and PC12x cells and nuclear extracts. Specifically, semi-quantitative EMSA with M1 probe resulted in significant signal loss at the band position that corresponded closely to the major band of wildtype PRE EMSA in both NB and PC12 nuclear extracts. Likewise, M1 mutant promoter/reporter expression clones resulted in significantly reduced levels of CAT reporter protein in both NB and PC12 cells. The M1 mutant deleted the predicted PuF site and both predicted SP1 sites in the PRE. We note that M2 and M4 each also deleted a single predicted SP1 site, the specific site differing between M2 and M4. EMSA analysis of these two mutants showed that M4 consistently had reduced EMSA interaction at band II, while M2 did not. However, CAT reporter levels were not consistently altered between cell types. There-fore, our mutation analysis confirms our earlier conclusion that the PRE is most likely to function as a site of PuF and SP1 activity. Disruption of the shared PuF/SP1 site in our system resulted in reduced levels of reporter gene product, which appears to contradict part of our proposed model. However primary sequence disruption of the site would influence both PuF (repressive) and SP1 (stimulatory) interaction very strongly. In addition, disruption of the AP2 site also resulted in loss of EMSA signal, suggesting that the PRE may also function under induction as well as constitutively. Currently, two DNA sequence polymorphisms have been reported for the PRE, specifically rs200621906 and rs201592736 [37]. Each is predicted to alter potential TF binding sites within the PRE (Table 7). Of particular note, rs201592736 may interfere with the PuF site. In addition, potentially interesting sites were created, including glucocorticoid/progesterone receptor (GR/PR), NF1-like enkephalin nuclear transcription factor 1 (NKTF1) retinoic acid receptor \u03b3 (RAR\u03b3), and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1),. Glucocorticoid levels are well associated with AD risk [70]. Progesterone supplementation has been linked to more rapid age-related cognitive decline in post-menopausal women [71,72]. Elevated levels of enkephalin contribute to neurological impairment and tau phosphorylation in AD model animals [73]. Upregulation of enkephalin accompanied by upregulation of APP due to an SNP in the PRE may overwhelm natural defenses against neurodegeneration. RARs direct APP processing toward the non-pathogenic \u03b1 pathway [74], and it is conceivable that a feedback mechanism that results in RAR-mediated overproduction of APP in a natural PRE mutant may overwhelm this process. ZEB1 interacts with TGF\u03b2 [75], and TGF\u03b2 is implicated in AD pathogenesis [76,77]. The rs201592736 SNP approximates our M2 mutant, while rs200621906 approximates M4. Combining both polymorphisms approximates the TF deletion effects of M1, which showed significant Bonferroni-adjusted reductions in both EMSA and CAT reporter by meta-analysis. Population frequency of these SNPs has not been published, and it has not been yet determined if they occur as a haplotype or independently. It should be cautioned that, although they have interesting potential TF site changes, functional association with any disease state has also not been determined. Table 7. Natural SNP in the PREThe PRE is strongly conserved in placental mammals, particularly the PuF/SP1 overlapping site. In addition, this conservation occurs in a promoter region that has undergone significant non-neutral (i. e., non-molecular clock) change. In particular, primate and mouse/rat sequences diverge the most from each other in our root-to-tip ana-lysis, but with far less difference when considering the PRE, specifically. We propose that this particular short segment of the APP proximal regulatory region has been specifically maintained, as would be expected of an active promoter segment. We have previously stated that other AD-associated gene promoters, such as for APOE, have important differences between mouse and human [25]. Likewise, we have reported both differences and similarities between human and rat cell line responses to functional promoter deletion clones of the human MAPT promoter [26]. Such overall differences can be put to use in identifying potentially critical regions of similarity, such as the PRE within the APP promoter. Although two SNPs have been reported in the human PRE, it is unlikely, given their obscurity in the literature, that these would be common enough to explain a large proportion of sporadic AD. We propose that the majority of etiologically important PuF vs. SP1 disruption in the PRE would be due to environmental influences on epigenetic markers. The naturally-occurring SNPs could serve as a potential test bed, given their similarity in terms of TF site disruption to some of our synthetic mutants. It is potentially more interesting that the Puf/SP1 site consists primarily of GG and GGG sequences, which are particularly vulnerable to DNA oxidation [78]. While SP1 activity is sensitive to epigenetic DNA modification [79], and PuF operates in repair of DNA damage [80], relative effects of DNA oxidation upon each protein\u2019s activity as a transcription factor have not been established. Likewise, CpG dimers (sites of cytosine methylation) are immediately adjacent to the PuF/SP1 site. Thus, in our system, while disrupting both PuF and SP1 activity by primary sequence mutation may result in overall reduction in reporter levels, environmentally-induced epigenetic alterations to the shared target DNA sequence may favor SP1 stimulation over PuF inhibition. In light of the knowledge that overall PuF activity may be reduced in AD, we do not suggest that epigenetic modification of the PRE would be the sole cause of the disorder. Rather, it would contribute to disruption of normal APP gene expression that would accompany AD. Feedback mechanisms between APP and other misregulated AD associated genes may serve to also reduce PuF activity in concert with direct disruption of APP-PuF interaction. We admit that our current assignment of PuF and SP1 to active status within the PRE has not yet been directly tested. Mammalian PuF is associated with inhibition of invasive metastasis [81-84] and stimulation of normal cell proliferation [85,86]. PuF kinase activity was reduced in human brain in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Down syndrome [87]. Total APP mRNA is elevated in AD brain, specifically KPI(+) isoforms [88]. APP gene expression and SP1 activity are increased in aging primate brains [31]. SP1-DNA interaction and APP expression in mouse brains are increased in a latent fashion by early-life dietary administration of Pb [29]. We suggest an antagonistic role between PuF and SP1, specifically that PuF may serve to downregulate APP gene expression via the PRE in vivo, and increases in effective SP1 activity, due to increased SP1 levels, interference in PuF-DNA interaction at the PRE, or decrease in PuF levels, for example, may overwhelm PuF regulation. The PuF transcription factor/kinase was discovered in the context of inhibiting metastasis [28]. Such inhibition included through interaction with the MYC gene promoter [89,90]. Later, PuF was determined to also function as a kinase independently of its TF activity [91]. PuF TF activity was determined to not only act to inhibit metastasis, but to also operate in non-metastatic cell proliferation [85,86]. In addition to cell proliferative activity, PuF regulates insulin secretion from pancreas islet cells [92], providing another molecular link underlying the recently-proposed metabolic-cognitive syndrome that may unite metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders [93]. We propose that these aspects of PuF may prove important in understanding both AD pathogenesis and the possibility that a role may be played by APP gene products in oncogenesis. Of greater interest is that PuF has already been indirectly linked to AD before our work with the PRE. PuF interacts with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1 (CAMK2N1) [94]. CAMK2N1 is, itself, a potent inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2), which is a mediator of learning and memory [95]. CAMK2 is currently a target of several anti-AD drugs under investigation [96]. Of particular note is that the PRE exists within a DNAse I hypersensitive region [97], and PuF activity is modulated by the presence or absence of a DNAse I hypersensitive region [87]. Likewise, among its amazing variety of functions [98,99], the APP protein is a ferroxidase and activates ferroportin to export iron from neurons [100]. Iron chelation reduces APP protein levels through the APP mRNA 5\u2019-UTR [101], and this is reversed by iron supplementation. Conversely, overexpression of APP results in reduced iron content and increased oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma cells [102]. Although it has also been shown that abnormally high levels of iron accumulate in specific brain regions in AD, particularly within and around amyloid plaques [103], this is not paradoxical, since plaque-associated iron would be extracellular and could be in part due to overactivity of APP in iron transport. In addition, faulty iron metabolism has been strongly linked to cancer and neoplasia, specifically through ferroportin activity [104], and increased serum iron is associated with greater risk for oxidative damage to DNA [105]. Of particular interest for a possible oncology/APP association is that expression of the APP gene in response to iron chelators distinctly differed between neoplastic and normal cell lines [106]. In cancer patients, increased APP gene expression was more common in tumor tissue of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients than in non-cancerous matched tissue samples. More importantly, in those patients who had elevated APP expression, survival at 24 months was 48% vs. 82% for patients with non-elevated APP expression [107]. This suggests that PuF may exert anti-metastatic properties by, in part, altering levels of APP expression, reducing overall results of APP protein\u2019s ferroxidase activity and modulating cancer risk. Basal activity of the APP promoter is greatest in neural origin cell lines, and several promoter elements close to the PRE are important for this activity [108]. For example, the APP promoter contains binding sites for important TFs, such as purine-rich element binding protein-\u03b1 (PUR\u03b1) [109] and early growth response 1 (EGR1) [110]. Notably, there is a high expression of PUR\u03b1 and EGR1 in neurons during brain development and in the adult brain, and negative regulation of APP gene expression by PUR\u03b1 [109]. ConclusionsInterference with TF binding to the PRE in the context of the complete APP promoter could serve to deregulate APP production. Deletion of the PRE from a complete series of APP promoter clones resulted in a 3 to 4 fold gain of promoter activity in NB cells as measured by levels of reporter gene product [27]. While AP2 and USF2 (implicated in our antibody supershifts) are generally stimulatory factors, the normal function of PuF is usually inhibitory of pathogenic cell proliferation, specifically metastasis [83,84]. In addition to inhibiting metastasis, PuF serves to induce normal cell proliferation [83,84]. The APP protein, among its non-pathological functions, is active in the \u201cneuronal pruning\u201d stage of brain development, wherein neurons in the early brain are selectively removed after rapid proliferation [111]. In addition to neurogenesis, PuF homologues regulate early morphological development [112]. Thus, as PuF serves to stimulate non-pathogenic cell proliferation, and APP can act to reduce cell proliferation, it is reasonable to propose the possibility that PuF acts to downregulate APP expression under normal circumstances, and interference in PuF regulation through the PRE could serve to deregulate APP gene expression, potentially contributing to AD pathogenesis (Figure 10). A\u03b2 is a minority product of APP processing [113]. Therefore, increase in APP levels could raise A\u03b2 above a risk threshold for AD. A theoretical union of oncogenic and neurodegenerative models has been proposed in the latent early-life associated regulation (LEARn) model of idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders [38,39], expands and extends the \u201cn-hit\u201d model of pathogenesis commonly accepted in oncology to \u201csporadic\u201d neurodegenerative disorders. Given that the predicted PuF site may be structurally vulnerable to GG oxidation, and thus subject to the LEARn model, we conclude that our work suggests connections between processes that lead to cancer etiology and sporadic neurobiological disorders, both conceptually (LEARn vs. n-hit) and mechanistically (PuF regulation of APP vs. PuF regulation of metastasis). thumbnailFigure 10. Model of Antagonistic PuF vs. SP1 regulation of the APP gene and disruption in AD. A. Non-pathogenic APP expression, levels regulated by PuF. In normal brain, PuF would compete with SP1 at the PRE and result in normal levels of APP mRNA and protein. A\u03b2 would be restricted to non-pathogenic concentrations. B. Pathogenic APP expression resulting from disruption of PuF regulation of the PRE. Disruption of the PRE, such as through environmentally induced DNA oxidation at GG dimers, \u201c*\u201d, may reduce affinity of the PRE for PuF more severely than for SP1. Effective SP1 activity then serves to upregulate APP expression levels beyond a pathogenic threshold. MethodsReagents and enzymesUnless specifically noted otherwise, reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA) or Roche Life Science (Indianapolis, IN). Cell culturePC12 and NB cell lines were obtained from ATCC and cultured as described previously [114]. The plates were incubated in 5% CO2 in a 37\u00b0C incubator. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen/Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). PRE fragments and oligomersThe rhesus monkey APP promoter clone p\u03b2XbB [17] (Figure 11) was digested with restriction enzymes PvuII and XhoI and run on a 10% TAE-polyacrylamide gel. The cell type specific 30 nt (\u221276/\u221247) PRE [27] was purified and end-labeled with \u03b332P-ATP (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). In addition, oligomers corresponding to this sequence and its reverse complement were synthesized (Invitrogen) and similarly radiolabeled. The oligomer pair differs from the plasmid fragment in that it does not have a \u201cTCGA\u201d 5\u2032 overhang. This overhang was filled for wildtype and mutant (see \u201cSemiquantitative EMSA of mutant PRE oligomers\u2026\u201d, herein) synthetic double-stranded oligomers. thumbnailFigure 11. Clone p\u03b2XbB. A deletion series of 6kb of the APP promoter and 5\u2032-UTR was previously constructed [17]. Within this series, an XbaI/BamHI 408bp fragment of the APP proximal promoter and 5\u2032-UTR was inserted in the expression vector pBLCAT3 (Promega). This fragment contained the PRE. The clone was used as the base template for all mutagenesis described herein. Analysis of potential transcription factor binding sites on the PREThe TESS [40] and MatInspector [41] utilities were used to probe the TransFac database with the PRE sequence. EMSA of PRE fragments in human tissue nuclear extractsCell nuclei extracts from human brain, heart, liver, and lungs were prepared as previously described [115,116]. The assay was carried out with 40 pg of PRE from digestion of p\u03b2XbB (about 10,000 cpm) and 10 to 20 \u03bcg of nuclear extracts. Radioactive probe was incubated with human brain, heart, liver, or lung nuclear extracts in 24\u03bcl of EMSA-binding buffer (Active Motif, Carlsbad CA) at 6\u00b0\u20138\u00b0C for 40 minutes. The samples were mixed with loading dye and the products of the reaction were separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in 1 x TGE (50 mM Tris, 384 mM glycine, and 2 mM EDTA). The gel was dried and exposed to X-ray film for autoradiography. Free oligonucleotides ran at the bottom of the gel. Protein-DNA complexes were detected as mobility-retarded bands. EMSA in nuclear extracts from normal and variously stimulated PC12 and human U937 cells Nuclear extracts were obtained commercially (ActiveMotif). PRE oligomer pairs were annealed and radiolabeled as described herein. Radioactive oligomer pairs were incubated with nuclear extracts from PC12, hypoxic PC12, U937, and U937 stimulated with either IFN-\u03b3, TPA, or IFN-\u03b3 + TPA. In addition, one sample was incubated with U937 nuclear extracts and 200x molar excess of unlabeled PRE oligomer pairs. Reaction mixtures were analyzed on nondenaturing PAGE and the gel used for autoradiography. Competition EMSA in nuclear extracts from NB and HeLa cellsCell nuclear extracts from NB and either HeLa cultures or HeLa treated with TPA were obtained commercially (Active Motif). Oligomer pairs for the PRE were annealed and radiolabeled as described herein. Nuclear extracts and oligomer pairs were incubated as described herein, except that some individual samples were incubated with 200x molar excess of unlabeled oligomer pairs. NB extracts were either uncompeted or competed against unlabeled PRE or commercially-obtained oligomer pairs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) known to bind AP1, AP2, SP1, or USF1. EMSA in unstimulated HeLa extracts was not subject to competition.
